## Common OKR Pitfalls

### What to Avoid
```markdown
## ⚠️ OKR Anti-Patterns

### Bad Objectives
❌ "Improve engineering" (too vague)
✅ "Build a world-class engineering culture"

❌ "Make more money" (uninspiring)
✅ "Become the revenue leader in our category"

### Bad Key Results
❌ "Launch new feature" (task, not outcome)
✅ "Achieve 50% adoption of new feature"

❌ "Improve customer satisfaction" (not measurable)
✅ "Increase NPS from 32 to 50"

❌ "Try harder" (not specific)
✅ "Reduce response time from 24hr to 2hr"

### Process Mistakes
- Too many OKRs (>3-5 per level)
- Cascading instead of aligning
- Treating as performance review
- Setting and forgetting
- Only top-down planning
- Sandbagging targets
```
