  name: Persona Development
  type: interactive
  priority: high

```

## Prerequisites

## Interactive Flow

### STEP 1: Context Gathering
ASK the user:
1. What product/service are these personas for?
2. B2B or B2C personas (or both)?
3. How many personas do you need (typically 3-5)?
4. Do you have any customer data or research?
5. What decisions will these personas inform?

WAIT for responses.

### STEP 2: Segment Identification
Based on context:
- Identify potential customer segments
- Present segmentation options:
  1. Demographic-based (age, income, location)
  2. Behavioral-based (usage patterns, preferences)
  3. Needs-based (problems, goals)
  4. Psychographic (values, lifestyle)
  5. Combined approach

ASK: "Which segmentation approach fits your market best?"

### STEP 3: Persona Framework
EXPLAIN the persona components we'll develop:

**Demographics/Firmographics:**
- Age, gender, income (B2C)
- Company size, industry, role (B2B)

**Psychographics:**
- Goals and motivations
- Values and priorities
- Fears and frustrations

**Behaviors:**
- Daily routines
- Technology usage
- Information sources
- Purchase behavior

**Needs & Pain Points:**
- Primary challenges
- Unmet needs

ASK: "Any specific attributes important for your personas?"

### STEP 4: Primary Persona Development
For the first/primary persona:

ASK progressively:
1. "Describe your ideal customer in one sentence"
2. "What's their biggest challenge related to [product area]?"
3. "How do they currently solve this problem?"
4. "What would make their life significantly better?"
5. "What might prevent them from using your solution?"

Based on responses, CREATE a detailed persona including:
- Name and representative photo description
- Background story
- Goals (professional and personal)
- Challenges and pain points
- Success criteria
- Preferred channels and influences
- Quotes that capture their mindset

PRESENT the persona and ASK: "Does this feel accurate? What should we adjust?"

### STEP 5: Additional Personas
For each additional persona:
- Ensure distinct from others
- Highlight key differences
- Show why they need different approaches

ASK: "Should we develop the next persona now?"

### STEP 6: Persona Validation
For each persona, VALIDATE:
1. Realistic and based on research
2. Distinct from other personas
3. Actionable for decision-making
4. Memorable and relatable

ASK: "Do these personas represent your full target market?"
