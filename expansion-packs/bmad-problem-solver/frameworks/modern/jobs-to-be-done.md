# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

## Overview
Jobs-to-be-Done is a theory and framework for understanding customer motivation. It focuses on the progress customers are trying to make in their lives, rather than on customer characteristics or product features. Developed by Clayton Christensen and refined by Anthony Ulwick and others, JTBD helps organizations innovate by understanding the "job" customers hire products to do.

## When to Use
- Product innovation and development
- Understanding customer behavior
- Market segmentation and positioning
- Competitive analysis and strategy
- Feature prioritization decisions
- Customer journey optimization
- Identifying new market opportunities

## Core JTBD Principles

### 1. **Jobs are Functional, Emotional, and Social**
```
🎯 JOB DIMENSIONS:

FUNCTIONAL JOB:
• The practical task to be done
• Measurable outcomes
• Performance metrics

EMOTIONAL JOB:
• How customer wants to feel
• Personal fulfillment
• Stress reduction

SOCIAL JOB:
• How customer wants to be perceived
• Status and identity
• Social connections
```

### 2. **Jobs are Stable, Solutions Change**
```
⏰ STABILITY PRINCIPLE:

JOB (Stable): "Get from Point A to Point B"
├── Horse & Carriage (1800s)
├── Automobile (1900s)
├── Airplane (1950s)
├── Uber/Lyft (2010s)
└── Autonomous Vehicles (Future)

The job remains constant; solutions evolve.
```

## Job Statement Framework

### Basic Job Statement Structure:
```
📝 JOB STATEMENT TEMPLATE:

When I [situation], I want to [motivation], 
so I can [expected outcome].

EXAMPLES:
• When I'm commuting to work, I want to be productive, 
  so I can accomplish more in my day.

• When I'm cooking dinner, I want to minimize cleanup, 
  so I can spend more time with my family.

• When I'm presenting to executives, I want to appear confident, 
  so I can advance my career.
```

### Advanced Job Statement (ODI Format):
```
🎯 OUTCOME-DRIVEN INNOVATION FORMAT:

Direction + Performance Metric + Object + Clarifier

EXAMPLES:
• Minimize + the time + to prepare a meal + that meets dietary restrictions
• Increase + the accuracy + of financial forecasts + for quarterly planning  
• Reduce + the likelihood + of security breaches + while maintaining usability
```

## JTBD Research Methods

### 1. **Switch Interviews**
Understanding why customers switched from one solution to another:

```
🔄 SWITCH INTERVIEW STRUCTURE:

TIMELINE QUESTIONS:
"Tell me about the last time you switched..."
"Walk me through that decision process..."
"What was happening in your life at that time?"

TRIGGER QUESTIONS:
"What caused you to start looking?"
"What was the first thought of a new solution?"
"What made you realize your old way wasn't working?"

EVALUATION QUESTIONS:
"What did you consider?"
"How did you evaluate options?"
"What were the tradeoffs?"

ANXIETY QUESTIONS:
"What were you worried about?"
"What almost stopped you from switching?"
"What convinced you to move forward?"
```

### 2. **Job Story Mapping**
```
📋 JOB STORY MAP:

SITUATION → MOTIVATION → EXPECTED OUTCOME
    ↓           ↓            ↓
CONTEXT     DRIVING FORCE   SUCCESS CRITERIA
    ↓           ↓            ↓
When I      I want to      So I can
[trigger]   [job]          [outcome]

EXAMPLE MAP:
When I'm preparing for an important client presentation
├── Context: High-stakes meeting, reputation on line
├── Motivation: Create compelling, professional slides  
└── Outcome: Win client confidence and secure contract
```

### 3. **Forces of Progress**
```
⚖️ FOUR FORCES MODEL:

PUSH OF THE SITUATION      PULL OF NEW SOLUTION
(Problems with status quo) ←→ (Attraction to new way)
           ↑                        ↑
           │      PROGRESS          │
           │         ▲              │
           ↓         │              ↓
HABIT OF PRESENT    ANXIETY OF      
(Inertia)           NEW SOLUTION    
                    (Fear of change)

BALANCE POINT: Change happens when Push + Pull > Habit + Anxiety
```

## JTBD Analysis Framework

## Advanced JTBD Techniques

### 1. **Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI)**
```
🎯 ODI PROCESS:

1. DEFINE JOB EXECUTOR
   Who is trying to get the job done?

2. DEFINE JOB TO BE DONE  
   What job is the customer trying to accomplish?

3. DEFINE JOB STEPS
   What are the process steps to get the job done?

4. DEFINE DESIRED OUTCOMES
   What does the customer want to achieve at each step?

5. DEFINE UNMET OUTCOMES
   Which outcomes are most important and least satisfied?

6. DEFINE SEGMENTS
   Which groups of customers have different unmet outcomes?

7. DEFINE SOLUTIONS
   What concepts best address unmet outcomes?
```

### 2. **Jobs-as-Progress Framework**
```
📈 PROGRESS DIMENSIONS:

FUNCTIONAL PROGRESS:
• Tasks completed
• Performance improved  
• Efficiency gained

EMOTIONAL PROGRESS:
• Confidence increased
• Stress reduced
• Satisfaction improved

SOCIAL PROGRESS:
• Status enhanced
• Relationships strengthened
• Identity reinforced
```

### 3. **Competing Against Non-Consumption**
```
💡 NON-CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS:

WHO: People who could benefit but don't use existing solutions
WHY NOT: Barriers preventing adoption
• Too expensive
• Too complex
• Too time-consuming
• Doesn't fit situation

OPPORTUNITY: Simplified solutions for non-consumers

EXAMPLE:
Traditional accounting software vs. QuickBooks
• Job: "Keep track of business finances"
• Non-consumers: Small business owners
• Barrier: Complexity of enterprise solutions
• Solution: Simplified, affordable accounting
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Focus on progress, not products
- Use customer language, not internal jargon
- Include all three job dimensions (functional, emotional, social)
- Look for struggling moments and workarounds
- Consider non-consumption as competition
- Validate jobs with real customer research
- Update job understanding regularly

### ❌ Don't:
- Define jobs around your product
- Use demographic segmentation exclusively
- Ignore emotional and social dimensions
- Assume you know the job without research
- Create jobs that are too narrow or broad
- Stop at functional job definition
- Force-fit JTBD to all situations

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### JTBD + Design Thinking:
```
🎨 INTEGRATION APPROACH:

EMPATHIZE: Understand jobs customers are trying to do
DEFINE: Frame challenge as job-to-be-done
IDEATE: Generate solutions for job steps
PROTOTYPE: Test job completion effectiveness
TEST: Validate job satisfaction and progress
```

### JTBD + Agile Development:
```
🏃 AGILE INTEGRATION:

USER STORIES:
"As a [job executor], I want to [make progress on job] 
so that I can [achieve desired outcome]"

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
Based on job performance metrics and desired outcomes

EPIC STRUCTURE:
Organized around major job steps or related jobs
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: **Solution-Centric Jobs**
❌ "Use our app to track expenses"
✅ "Stay within budget while running a business"

### Pitfall 2: **Too Functional**
❌ Only considering task completion
✅ Including emotional and social dimensions

### Pitfall 3: **Wrong Level of Abstraction**
❌ "Breathe" (too high) or "Click button" (too low)
✅ "Feel confident in social situations" (just right)

### Pitfall 4: **Demographic Confusion**
❌ "Jobs for millennials"
✅ "Jobs that people in certain situations have"

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Job statements validated with customer research
- ✅ Clear understanding of functional, emotional, and social dimensions
- ✅ Job hierarchy mapped from high to low level
- ✅ Forces of progress identified and measured
- ✅ Unmet needs identified with priority ranking
- ✅ Solutions designed around job completion
- ✅ Job performance improvement measurable
