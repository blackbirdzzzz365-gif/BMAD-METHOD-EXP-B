# Product Management Knowledge Base

## Core PM Principles

### 1. User-Centric Product Development
- Start with user problems, not solutions
- Validate assumptions through research and testing
- Measure success by user outcomes, not feature delivery
- Build empathy through direct user interaction
- Iterate based on feedback and data

### 2. Strategic Thinking
- Balance short-term wins with long-term vision
- Consider second and third-order effects
- Think in systems and platforms, not just features
- Understand business model implications
- Maintain competitive awareness

### 3. Data-Driven Decision Making
- Define metrics before building
- Distinguish between vanity and actionable metrics
- Use both qualitative and quantitative data
- Run controlled experiments
- Accept that not all decisions can be data-driven

## Key PM Frameworks

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
**Core Concept**: People "hire" products to get jobs done in their lives.

**Framework Structure**:
- **Main Job**: The primary outcome users seek
- **Related Jobs**: Supporting tasks around the main job
- **Emotional Jobs**: How users want to feel
- **Social Jobs**: How users want to be perceived

**Key Questions**:
- What progress is the user trying to make?
- What are the circumstances of struggle?
- What are users currently hiring to do this job?
- What would have to be true for them to switch?

**Application**:
- Use for product discovery and innovation
- Frame features as job executors
- Identify underserved jobs as opportunities
- Avoid feature-centric thinking

### OKR Framework
**Objectives and Key Results** align teams around measurable goals.

**Objective Qualities**:
- Qualitative and inspirational
- Ambitious but achievable
- Time-bound (usually quarterly)
- Aligned with company strategy
- Memorable and motivating

**Key Result Qualities**:
- Quantitative and measurable
- Specific and unambiguous
- Aggressive but realistic (70% = success)
- Observable by third parties
- Controllable by team

**Best Practices**:
- Limit to 3-5 objectives per period
- Each objective has 3-5 key results
- Cascade but don't copy from above
- Grade honestly and learn from misses
- Separate OKRs from performance reviews

### RICE Prioritization
**Formula**: Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

**Reach** (per time period):
- Number of users affected
- Frequency of impact
- Be specific about time frame

**Impact** scale:
- 3 = Massive impact
- 2 = High impact
- 1 = Medium impact
- 0.5 = Low impact
- 0.25 = Minimal impact

**Confidence** (percentage):
- Based on evidence quality
- Previous similar experiences
- Reduces overconfidence bias

**Effort** (person-months):
- Include all disciplines
- Consider dependencies
- Account for complexity

**Usage Tips**:
- Use consistently across initiatives
- Document assumptions
- Revisit scores quarterly
- Consider strategic adjustments

### Platform vs Feature Decisions

**Feature Approach When**:
- Single, specific use case
- Quick market validation needed
- Resource constrained
- Low reuse potential
- Learning phase

**Platform Approach When**:
- Multiple use cases identified
- Core to product strategy
- High reuse expected
- Ecosystem enablement
- Scale is priority

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Number of potential use cases
- Strategic importance
- Resource availability
- Time to market pressure
- Technical debt implications
