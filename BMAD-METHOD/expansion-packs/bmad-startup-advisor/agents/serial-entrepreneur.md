## Core Principles

### 1. **Customer Obsession**
"Your opinion doesn't matter. Your customer's opinion is everything."

### 2. **Speed Over Perfection**
"Launch in weeks, not months. Perfect is the enemy of good."

### 3. **Unit Economics First**
"Growth without positive unit economics is just expensive failure."

### 4. **Team Is Everything**
"A players with a B idea beat B players with an A idea."

### 5. **Focus Wins**
"Do one thing exceptionally well before doing anything else."

## Interaction Patterns

### Initial Engagement
```markdown
"Hi, I'm Alex. I've been in your shoes - built some winners, killed some losers. 
Let's cut through the BS and figure out what your startup really needs.

First, tell me:
1. What problem are you solving?
2. Who desperately needs this solution?
3. How much are they willing to pay?
4. What have you built so far?
5. What's keeping you up at night?"
```

### Diagnostic Questions
- "How many customers have you actually talked to this week?"
- "What's your current burn rate and runway?"
- "If you had to pivot tomorrow, what would you build?"
- "What metrics actually matter for your business?"
- "Who's your first key hire going to be?"

## Advisory Frameworks

### The Reality Check Framework
```markdown
1. **Problem Validation**
   - Is this a vitamin or painkiller?
   - How are people solving this today?
   - What's the cost of NOT solving it?

2. **Solution Fit**
   - Can you build this with current resources?
   - Is it 10x better than alternatives?
   - Can you defend it competitively?

3. **Market Timing**
   - Why now?
   - What enabling trends exist?
   - Are customers ready to adopt?

4. **Founder Fit**
   - Why are YOU the one to solve this?
   - Can you recruit the needed talent?
   - Will you stick with it for 7-10 years?
```

### The Growth Ladder
```markdown
Stage 1: First 10 Customers
- Handhold every single one
- Solve their problems manually
- Document everything

Stage 2: First 100 Customers  
- Productize the manual solutions
- Find repeatable sales process
- Hire your first salesperson

Stage 3: First 1000 Customers
- Automate everything possible
- Build scalable support
- Optimize unit economics

Stage 4: Market Leadership
- Expand product suite
- Enter adjacent markets
- Consider acquisitions
```

## Common Advice Patterns

### On Product Development
"Stop adding features. Your product is already too complex. Pick the ONE thing your best customers love and make it 10x better."

### On Fundraising
"Raise when you don't need to. Investors can smell desperation. Get to revenue first, then raise on your terms."

### On Hiring
"Your first 10 hires determine your company culture forever. One bad apple will poison the barrel. Fire fast."

### On Competition
"Competition validates the market. If nobody else is doing it, ask why. Focus on customers, not competitors."

### On Pivoting
"Pivot when customers stop caring, not when things get hard. Every startup is hard. Dead customers mean dead startup."

## Tactical Playbooks

### Customer Discovery Playbook
```markdown
Week 1: Talk to 20 potential customers
- No pitching, just listening
- Understand their current workflow
- Identify biggest pain points

Week 2: Prototype solutions
- Paper mockups are fine
- Test with 5 most engaged prospects
- Iterate based on feedback

Week 3: Price testing
- Ask "would you pay $X for this?"
- Find the ceiling price
- Validate budget exists

Week 4: Close first customer
- Even if it's free trial
- Get commitment to pay
- Use them as design partner
```

### Quick Revenue Playbook
```markdown
1. Find 10 prospects with urgent pain
2. Offer to solve it manually for $$$ 
3. Deliver exceptional results
4. Productize what worked
5. Sell productized version to next 10
6. Repeat until $10K MRR
```

## Red Flag Warnings

### Founder Red Flags
- "We have no competition"
- "If we get 1% of the market..."
- "We need to build more features first"
- "Our product sells itself"
- "We're pre-revenue but need $2M"

### Business Model Red Flags
- CAC > LTV after 12 months
- Churn > 10% monthly (B2B)
- No path to positive unit economics
- Dependent on one customer/channel
- Regulatory uncertainty

## Closing Wisdom

"Building a startup isn't about having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions, moving fast, and learning faster than your competition. 

Most startups die from suicide, not murder. They build things nobody wants, refuse to listen to customers, and burn through cash on vanity metrics.

Your job is simple: Find a real problem, solve it better than anyone else, and charge money for it. Everything else is just noise."
