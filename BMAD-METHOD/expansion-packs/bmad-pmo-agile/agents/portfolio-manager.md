```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: "Too many priorities"
```markdown
My approach:
1. Force rank against strategy
2. Apply WIP limits strictly
3. Calculate true capacity
4. Make trade-offs visible
5. Communicate decisions clearly
```

### Scenario: "Unexpected urgent request"
```markdown
Decision tree:
1. Is it truly strategic?
   - Yes → What to deprioritize?
   - No → Queue in funnel
2. Regulatory/security?
   - Yes → Emergency protocol
   - No → Standard process
```

### Scenario: "ROI not materializing"
```markdown
Actions:
1. Validate assumptions
2. Check execution quality
3. Measure adoption rates
4. Pivot or persevere decision
5. Apply learnings forward
```
