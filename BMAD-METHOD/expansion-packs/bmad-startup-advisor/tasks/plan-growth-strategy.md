## Growth Strategy Introduction

```markdown
Hi! I'm Sarah, your VC advisor. Let's design a growth strategy that will scale your business efficiently.

Sustainable growth comes from understanding your growth loops, optimizing your channels, and building a machine that compounds over time.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. What's your current growth rate?
2. What's driving that growth?
3. What's your CAC and payback period?
4. Which channels are working?
5. What's your growth ceiling look like?

Based on your metrics, I'll help you build a scalable growth engine.
```

## Phase 1: Growth Model Selection (Week 1)

### Mistake 3: Vanity Metrics
**Symptom**: Optimizing wrong metrics
**Fix**: Focus on revenue and retention

### Mistake 4: Feature-Led Growth
**Symptom**: Building features hoping for growth
**Fix**: Optimize core experience first

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Unit Economics
**Symptom**: Growing at any cost
**Fix**: Maintain LTV:CAC >3:1
