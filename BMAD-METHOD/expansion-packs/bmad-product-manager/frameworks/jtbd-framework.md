# Jobs-to-be-Done Framework Guide

## Overview
Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding what motivates people to make the choices they do. People don't buy products; they "hire" them to get jobs done.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus on Progress
Users are trying to make progress in their lives. Understand:
- Where they are now (current state)
- Where they want to be (desired state)
- What's blocking progress (constraints)

### 2. Circumstances Matter
The context in which a job arises is critical:
- When does this job become important?
- Where does it occur?
- Who else is involved?
- What constraints exist?

### 3. Competition is Broad
Your competition isn't just similar products:
- Current solutions (even if makeshift)
- Doing nothing
- DIY approaches
- Hiring people

## Job Categories

### Functional Jobs
The practical task to accomplish:
- "Cut a piece of wood"
- "Transfer money to friend"
- "Track project progress"

### Emotional Jobs
How people want to feel:
- "Feel confident about decision"
- "Avoid anxiety about overspending"
- "Feel in control of schedule"

### Social Jobs
How people want to be perceived:
- "Look professional in meetings"
- "Be seen as innovative"
- "Demonstrate competence"

## JTBD Interview Technique

### Setup Questions
1. "When did you first start looking for something to solve [problem]?"
2. "Tell me about the last time you [experienced this problem]"
3. "What were you trying to accomplish?"

### Progress Questions
1. "What kind of solutions did you try?"
2. "What did you like/dislike about each?"
3. "What would a perfect solution do for you?"

### Four Forces Questions
**Push** (problems with current state):
- "What's frustrating about your current approach?"

**Pull** (attraction to new solution):
- "What attracted you to [new solution]?"

**Anxiety** (concerns about change):
- "What worried you about switching?"

**Habit** (comfort with status quo):
- "What would you miss about current approach?"

## Job Story Format

Instead of: "As a [persona], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"

Use: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]"

Examples:
- "When I'm planning my week on Sunday night, I want to see all my commitments in one place, so I can spot conflicts before they happen"
- "When my team asks about project status in our standup, I want to quickly show our progress, so I can maintain credibility and trust"

## Identifying Opportunities

### Underserved Jobs
- Important but not satisfied well
- People cobble together solutions
- High willingness to pay

### Overserved Jobs
- Current solutions too complex
- Features unused
- Opportunity to simplify

### Non-consumption
- No current solution hired
- Job remains undone
- Latent demand exists

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Focusing on Demographics
Wrong: "Millennials want mobile apps"
Right: "When I'm commuting, I want to use my time productively"

### 2. Leading with Solutions
Wrong: "Users want dashboards"
Right: "Users want to understand their business health at a glance"

### 3. Ignoring Emotional/Social Jobs
Wrong: Only focusing on functional requirements
Right: Understanding the full job complexity

### 4. Narrow Competition View
Wrong: "Our competition is other SaaS products"
Right: "We compete with spreadsheets, consultants, and doing nothing"

## Applying JTBD to Product Development

### Discovery
- Interview users about struggles
- Identify job statements
- Map current solutions
- Find opportunities

### Definition
- Frame features as job executors
- Define success as job completion
- Consider all job dimensions
- Write job stories

### Validation
- Test job hypotheses
- Measure job satisfaction
- Iterate based on completion
- Refine understanding

### Marketing
- Message around jobs
- Show progress enabled
- Address anxieties
- Highlight outcomes

## JTBD Prioritization

Evaluate jobs based on:
1. **Importance**: How important is this job to users?
2. **Satisfaction**: How well is it currently served?
3. **Frequency**: How often does the job arise?
4. **Willingness to Pay**: Will users pay for better solution?

**Opportunity Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)**

High importance + Low satisfaction = High opportunity

## Examples by Industry

### B2B SaaS
Job: "When I'm preparing for board meetings, I want to quickly create compelling data visualizations, so I can clearly communicate our progress and secure continued support"

### E-commerce
Job: "When I'm gift shopping under time pressure, I want to find something thoughtful without extensive research, so I can maintain relationships while managing my busy life"

### Healthcare
Job: "When I notice concerning symptoms, I want to understand if I need immediate care, so I can protect my health without unnecessary anxiety or expense"

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### With OKRs
- Objectives address important jobs
- Key Results measure job satisfaction
- Initiatives execute job solutions

### With RICE
- Reach: How many have this job?
- Impact: How important is the job?
- Confidence: How well do we understand it?
- Effort: Complexity to satisfy job

### With User Stories
- Transform jobs into stories
- Maintain job context
- Define acceptance as job done
- Test against job success
