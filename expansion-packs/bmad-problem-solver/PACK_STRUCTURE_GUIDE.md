# Problem Solver Pack Structure Guide

## 🧠 Overview

The Problem Solver expansion pack transforms your AI agents into expert problem-solving consultants who use mental models, systems thinking, and visual frameworks to tackle complex business and operational challenges.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**"Make the complex simple, the invisible visible, and the impossible possible."**

Our approach:
1. **Decompose** - Break big problems into manageable pieces
2. **Analyze** - Apply multiple mental models and frameworks  
3. **Visualize** - Use diagrams and visuals for clarity
4. **Synthesize** - Build consensus among diverse perspectives
5. **Solve** - Generate actionable solutions with clear next steps

## 👥 Agent Team

### 1. Systems Thinking Expert (Dr. Sarah Chen)
- Sees interconnections and feedback loops
- Maps complex systems and dependencies
- Identifies leverage points for maximum impact

### 2. First Principles Thinker (Marcus Reid)
- Breaks problems down to fundamental truths
- Questions all assumptions
- Rebuilds solutions from the ground up

### 3. Critical Thinking Analyst (Dr. Angela Foster)
- Identifies logical fallacies and biases
- Validates reasoning and evidence
- Ensures rigorous analysis

### 4. Creative Problem Solver (Jordan Park)
- Generates innovative solutions
- Applies lateral thinking techniques
- Combines ideas in novel ways

### 5. Root Cause Analyst (Kenji Tanaka)
- Digs deep to find true causes
- Prevents symptom-focused solutions
- Uses structured investigation methods
