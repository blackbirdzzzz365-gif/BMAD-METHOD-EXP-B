## Pivot Analysis Introduction

```markdown
Hi! I'm Alex. Time for some tough love about pivoting.

Pivoting isn't failure - it's intelligent iteration. The best founders know when to persist and when to pivot.

**Honest Assessment:**
1. How long have you been stuck?
2. Are customers actually using your product?
3. Is growth flat or declining?
4. Are you out of ideas to try?
5. Has the team lost enthusiasm?

Let's analyze whether to pivot, and if so, how to do it successfully.
```

## Phase 1: Current State Diagnosis (Week 1)

### Step 1.1: Brutal Metrics Review
```markdown
**The Hard Truth Dashboard:**

Growth Metrics:
- MRR Growth: {{percentage}}% (last 6 months)
- User Growth: {{percentage}}% (last 6 months)
- Churn Rate: {{percentage}}% monthly
- CAC Trend: {{increasing/decreasing}}
- Burn Rate: ${{amount}}/month
- Runway: {{months}} remaining

Product Metrics:
- Active Users: {{percentage}}% of signups
- Feature Adoption: {{percentage}}%
- Session Length: {{duration}} (trend: ↓)
- Return Rate: {{percentage}}% weekly

Business Health:
- Team Morale: {{score}}/10
- Customer NPS: {{score}}
- Investor Confidence: {{level}}
- Competitive Position: {{weakening/stable}}

**Red Flag Count: {{number}}/12**

Critical Red Flags:
☐ Flat/declining growth >3 months
☐ Churn >10% monthly
☐ CAC > LTV
☐ <20% users active weekly
☐ Team morale <5/10
☐ Running out of experiments
```

### Step 1.2: Root Cause Analysis
```markdown
**The 5 Whys Deep Dive:**

Problem: Growth has stalled

Why 1: Users sign up but don't stick
→ Why? They don't find value quickly enough

Why 2: The value prop isn't clear
→ Why? We're trying to be everything

Why 3: We haven't focused on one use case
→ Why? Afraid to alienate potential users

Why 4: We don't know our best use case
→ Why? Haven't analyzed user segments deeply

Why 5: We've been building, not learning
→ Root Cause: {{your_root_cause}}

**Other Contributing Factors:**
□ Market timing off
□ Competition stronger
□ Team capability gaps
□ Resource constraints
□ Technology limitations
□ Business model flawed
```

### Step 1.3: Salvage Assessment
```markdown
**What's Working? (Be Honest)**

Assets to Keep:
1. **Team/Talent**
   - Strong engineers? {{yes/no}}
   - Domain expertise? {{yes/no}}
   - Good culture? {{yes/no}}

2. **Technology**
   - Reusable code? {{yes/no}}
   - Unique IP? {{yes/no}}
   - Data/algorithms? {{yes/no}}

3. **Market Position**
   - Brand value? {{yes/no}}
   - Customer relationships? {{yes/no}}
   - Partnerships? {{yes/no}}

4. **Learnings**
   - Customer insights: {{list}}
   - Market knowledge: {{list}}
   - What not to do: {{list}}

**Salvageable Value Score: {{X}}/10**
```
