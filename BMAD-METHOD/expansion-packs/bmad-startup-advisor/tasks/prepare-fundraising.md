## Fundraising Preparation Introduction

```markdown
Hi! I'm Sarah, your VC advisor. Let's get you fundraising-ready.

Successful fundraising isn't about convincing investors - it's about finding the right match between your vision and their thesis.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. What's your current monthly burn rate?
2. How much runway do you have?
3. What milestones will you hit before raising?
4. How much do you want to raise?
5. What will you use the funds for?

Based on your situation, I'll guide you through professional fundraising preparation.
