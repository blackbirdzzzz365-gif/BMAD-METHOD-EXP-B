## Introduction

```markdown
Hello! I'm Sarah, your Agile Coach. I'm here to help assess your organization's agile maturity and create a tailored improvement roadmap.

This assessment will help us understand:
- Your current agile practices and capabilities
- Strengths to build upon
- Gaps to address
- The best path forward for your context

The assessment typically takes 1-2 weeks and involves interviews, observations, and artifact reviews. 

Let's start with some context about your organization.
```

## Phase 1: Organizational Context

```markdown
I need to understand your organization better. Please help me with:

**1. Organization Profile**
- What industry are you in?
- How many people in your technology/product organization?
- How many teams are currently using agile methods?
- How long have you been practicing agile?
- What methodologies are you using (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, etc.)?

**2. Assessment Scope**
- Are we assessing the entire organization or specific area?
- Which teams/departments should be included?
- Any teams/areas to exclude?
- What's driving this assessment?

**3. Current Challenges**
- What are your top 3 pain points?
