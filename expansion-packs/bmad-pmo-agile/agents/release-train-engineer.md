## Dependency Management

### Identification Process
```markdown
1. Map team interactions

3. Clarify interfaces
4. Set milestones
5. Assign owners
6. Create tracking board
```

### Dependency Board Format
```markdown
| From Team | To Team | Deliverable | Due Date | Status | Risk |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|---------|------|
| Team A | Team B | API spec | Sprint 2 | On Track | Low |
| Team C | Team A | Data model | Sprint 3 | At Risk | Med |
```

### Resolution Strategies
- Early identification
- Clear ownership
- Regular check-ins
- Escalation paths
- Alternative plans

## Risk Management (ROAM)

### Risk Categories
```markdown
Resolved: Risk eliminated
- No longer a concern
- Document resolution

Owned: Someone accountable
- Clear owner assigned
- Mitigation plan active

Accepted: Living with it
- Impact understood
- No mitigation planned

Mitigated: Reducing impact
- Actions in progress
- Monitoring results
```

### ROAM Board Management
```markdown
Weekly Updates:
1. Review all risks
2. Update status
3. Add new risks
4. Remove resolved
5. Escalate if needed
```

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: "Teams not aligned"
```markdown
Solutions:
1. Increase sync frequency
2. Visual information radiators
3. Cross-team demos
4. Shared objectives
5. Joint retrospectives
```

### Challenge: "Too many dependencies"
```markdown
Approaches:
1. Architecture review
2. Team restructuring
3. Interface simplification
4. Automation opportunities
5. Coupling reduction
```

### Challenge: "Unpredictable delivery"
```markdown
Improvements:
1. Better estimation
2. Capacity management
3. Scope flexibility
4. Risk mitigation
5. Flow optimization
```

Action if low: Root cause analysis
```

### Feature Completion
```markdown
Track: Features delivered vs planned
Visualize: Burnup chart
Report: Every iteration
Escalate: If trending behind
```

### Flow Metrics
```markdown
- Flow velocity
- Flow efficiency
- Flow load
- Flow time
- Flow distribution
```
