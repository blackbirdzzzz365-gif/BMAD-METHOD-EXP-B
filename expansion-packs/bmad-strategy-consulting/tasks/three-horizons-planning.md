REQUIRED: Use this task for strategic growth planning using McKinsey's Three Horizons model

## Configuration
```yaml
task:
  name: Three Horizons Strategic Planning
  type: growth-strategy
  priority: high
  elicit: true
```

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of current business
- Growth ambitions defined
- Innovation appetite established
- Resource constraints known

## Framework Overview

The Three Horizons model balances:
- **Horizon 1**: Core business (70% resources) - Defend and extend
- **Horizon 2**: Emerging opportunities (20%) - Build and scale
- **Horizon 3**: Future options (10%) - Create and explore

## Interactive Flow

### STEP 1: Strategic Context
ASK the user:
1. What are your growth targets? (Revenue, timeline)
2. What is your risk appetite for innovation?
3. What resources can be allocated to new ventures?
4. What market disruptions do you anticipate?
5. How would you describe your innovation culture?

ESTABLISH growth gap:
```
Current Revenue: $[X]M
Target Revenue (Year Y): $[Z]M
Growth Gap: $[Z-X]M
Required CAGR: [%]
```

### STEP 2: Horizon 1 - Core Business Assessment

ANALYZE current business:

**Portfolio Review:**
```
Business Line | Revenue | Growth | Margin | Market Position | Future Potential
--------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------------|------------------
Product A | $XM | Y% | Z% | Leader | Defend
Product B | $XM | Y% | Z% | Challenger | Extend
Service C | $XM | Y% | Z% | Follower | Optimize
```

**H1 Strategic Options:**
1. **Defend**: Protect market share
2. **Extend**: Geographic/segment expansion
3. **Optimize**: Operational excellence
4. **Milk**: Maximize cash generation
5. **Exit**: Divestiture consideration

For each core business, DETERMINE:
- Maximum growth potential
- Investment requirements
- Competitive threats
- Strategic priority

H1 Growth Contribution:
```
Organic Growth: $[X]M
Share Gain: $[Y]M
Total H1 Contribution: $[X+Y]M
Remaining Gap: $[Gap - (X+Y)]M
```

### STEP 3: Horizon 2 - Emerging Opportunities

IDENTIFY H2 candidates:

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Market attractiveness (size, growth)
- Competitive advantage potential
- Capability fit
- Time to scale (2-5 years)
- Resource requirements

**H2 Opportunity Assessment:**
```
Opportunity | Market Size | Our Right to Win | Time to Scale | Investment | Priority
------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|------------|----------
New Product X | $[TAM] | [Rationale] | 3 years | $[X]M | High
New Market Y | $[TAM] | [Rationale] | 2 years | $[Y]M | Medium
Digital Platform | $[TAM] | [Rationale] | 4 years | $[Z]M | High
```

For top H2 opportunities, DEVELOP:
- Business case outline
- Capability requirements
- Partnership needs
- Success milestones
- Risk mitigation

H2 Growth Contribution:
```
H2 Opportunity 1: $[X]M by Year Y
H2 Opportunity 2: $[Y]M by Year Y
Total H2 Contribution: $[X+Y]M
```

### STEP 4: Horizon 3 - Future Options

EXPLORE H3 possibilities:

**Scanning Areas:**
- Technology disruptions
- Business model innovations
- Market white spaces

H2 | 12% | 5% of profits
H3 | 3% | 0% (investment)
```

**Target State:**
```
Horizon | Target Allocation | Expected Returns (Y+5)
--------|------------------|----------------------
H1 | 70% | 70% of profits
H2 | 20% | 25% of profits
H3 | 10% | 5% of profits
```

**Transition Plan:**
- Redirect H1 efficiency gains
- Sunset declining businesses
- Create innovation fund
- Establish venture board

### STEP 6: Capability Requirements

IDENTIFY capability gaps:

```
Capability | H1 Needs | H2 Needs | H3 Needs | Current State | Build/Buy/Partner
-----------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|------------------
Digital Tech | Moderate | Critical | Critical | Weak | Build + Hire
Data Analytics | High | Critical | High | Moderate | Build
Innovation Process | Low | High | Critical | Weak | Build + Partner
Agile Methods | Moderate | Critical | Critical | Low | Build + Train

Market | Medium | High | Low | Diversification
Technology | Low | High | Critical | Partnerships
Execution | Medium | High | High | Talent + Process
Financial | Low | Medium | Low | Stage-gate funding
Cultural | Medium | High | Critical | Change program
```

### STEP 9: Implementation Roadmap
