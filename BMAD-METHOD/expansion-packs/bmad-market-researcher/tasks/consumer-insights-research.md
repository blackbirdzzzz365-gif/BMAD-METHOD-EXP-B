task:
  name: Consumer Insights Research
  type: interactive
  priority: high
  elicit: true
```

## Prerequisites
- Product/service context
- Target market definition
- Research objectives

## Interactive Flow

### STEP 1: Research Objectives
ASK the user:
1. What specific consumer insights do you need?
2. What decisions will these insights inform?
3. Are you exploring:
   - Current behaviors and needs?
   - Future trends and desires?
   - Pain points and frustrations?
   - Purchase decisions and triggers?
4. Any specific consumer segments to focus on?

WAIT for responses.

### STEP 2: Behavioral Framework
EXPLAIN: "I'll use the Jobs-to-be-Done framework to understand what consumers are really trying to accomplish."

Present research areas:
1. **Functional Jobs:** What tasks are they trying to complete?
2. **Emotional Jobs:** How do they want to feel?
3. **Social Jobs:** How do they want to be perceived?

ASK: "Which dimension is most critical for your product/service?"

### STEP 3: Current State Analysis
Research and analyze:

**Current Behaviors:**
- How consumers currently address their needs
- Tools, products, or services they use
- Workarounds and hacks they employ
- Time and money spent on solutions

**Pain Points:**
- Frustrations with current solutions
- Unmet needs and desires
- Barriers to ideal outcomes
- Compromise points

ASK: "What specific behaviors or pain points should I investigate deeper?"

### STEP 4: Consumer Journey Mapping
MAP the consumer journey:

1. **Trigger:** What initiates the need?
2. **Research:** How do they explore options?
3. **Evaluation:** What criteria matter?
4. **Decision:** What drives the final choice?
5. **Experience:** How do they use and evaluate?
6. **Advocacy:** What makes them recommend?

For each stage, identify:
- Actions taken
- Emotions felt
- Influences and information sources
- Decision criteria
- Pain points and delighters

ASK: "Which journey stage is most critical for your strategy?"

### STEP 5: Deep Motivation Analysis

Present findings and ASK: "Which motivations resonate most with your vision?"

### STEP 6: Behavioral Segments
IDENTIFY distinct behavioral segments:

For each segment:
- Defining behaviors and characteristics
- Core motivations and needs
- Triggers and barriers
- Value perception

ASK: "Should we prioritize certain segments for deeper analysis?"

### STEP 7: Insights Synthesis
