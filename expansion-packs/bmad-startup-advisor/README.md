## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Customer Discovery
Always validate problems before building solutions. Use the customer discovery task to gather real insights.

### 2. Iterate Rapidly
Apply the Build-Measure-Learn cycle weekly. Speed of learning determines success.

### 3. Track the Right Metrics
Focus on actionable metrics that drive decisions, not vanity metrics that just look good.

### 4. Maintain Investor Relations
Send monthly updates whether things are good or bad. Build trust before you need it.

### 5. Plan for Multiple Scenarios
Always have Plan A, B, and C. Startups rarely go according to plan.

## Metrics to Track

### Early Stage
- Customer interviews completed
- Problem-solution fit score
- MVP usage metrics
- Customer acquisition cost
- Burn rate and runway

### Growth Stage

### Scale Stage
- Annual recurring revenue (ARR)
- Net revenue retention
- Gross margins
- Rule of 40
- Market share

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Building Without Validation
Don't build features nobody wants. Always validate with customers first.

### ‚ùå Raising Too Much Too Early
High valuations early can hurt later. Raise what you need, not what you can.

### ‚ùå Ignoring Unit Economics
Growth at all costs leads to failure. Ensure sustainable unit economics.

### ‚ùå Founder Burnout
Startups are marathons, not sprints. Maintain work-life balance.

### ‚ùå Analysis Paralysis
Perfect is the enemy of good. Make decisions with 70% information.
