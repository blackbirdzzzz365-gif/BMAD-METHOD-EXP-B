## Phase 0: Integrated Discovery (Week 1)

### Step 0.1: Opportunity Framing
**Lead:** senior-partner
**Participants:** All pack leads

**Adaptive Questions:**
1. **What's the strategic opportunity?**
   - Market expansion → Market-led path
   - Product innovation → Product-led path
   - Business transformation → Strategy-led path
   - Competitive threat → Integrated response path

2. **What's the primary constraint?**
   - Time pressure → Parallel workstreams
   - Resource limits → Phased approach
   - Uncertainty high → Sequential discovery
   - All constraints → Agile sprints

3. **What's the success criteria?**
   - Revenue growth → Commercial focus
   - Market position → Competitive focus
   - Innovation → Product focus
   - Efficiency → Operational focus

### Step 0.2: Workstream Design
**Adaptive Orchestration:**
```python
def design_workstreams(opportunity_type, constraints, criteria):
    if opportunity_type == "market_expansion":
        return {
            'lead': 'market_researcher',
            'sequence': ['market_analysis', 'product_fit', 'entry_strategy'],
            'parallel_work': ['competitive_intel', 'capability_assessment']
        }
    elif opportunity_type == "product_innovation":
        return {
            'lead': 'product_manager',
            'sequence': ['jobs_analysis', 'platform_decision', 'roadmap'],
            'parallel_work': ['market_validation', 'tech_feasibility']
        }
    elif opportunity_type == "transformation":
        return {
            'lead': 'strategy_consultant',
            'sequence': ['current_state', 'future_vision', 'roadmap'],
