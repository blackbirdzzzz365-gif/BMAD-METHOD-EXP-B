# Three Horizons Strategic Planning Framework

## Overview
The Three Horizons framework balances current performance with future growth by managing initiatives across different time horizons and risk levels.

## Core Concepts

### Horizon Definitions
- **Horizon 1:** Core business (70% resources) - Defend and extend
- **Horizon 2:** Emerging opportunities (20% resources) - Build and scale  
- **Horizon 3:** Future options (10% resources) - Create and explore

### Strategic Balance
```
H1: Cash generation, current profits
H2: Growth engines, scaling ventures
H3: Innovation seeds, future disruption
```
