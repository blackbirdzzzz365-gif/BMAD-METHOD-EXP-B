# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Complete Framework

## Overview
Jobs-to-be-Done is a framework for understanding why customers "hire" products to accomplish specific goals in their lives.

## Core Principles

### The Job Statement Formula
**When** [situation] **I want to** [motivation] **so I can** [expected outcome]

### Job Types
1. **Functional Jobs:** Practical tasks to complete
2. **Emotional Jobs:** Feelings to achieve
3. **Social Jobs:** How others perceive us

## Framework Components

### Phase 1: Job Discovery
**Step-by-step Process:**

1. **Customer Interview Preparation**
   - Recruit criteria:
     - Recent purchasers (last 90 days)
     - Switchers from competitors
     - Churned customers
     - Non-consumers
   - Interview guide:
     - Timeline reconstruction
     - First thought triggers
     - Alternative considerations
     - Purchase story
     - Outcome expectations

2. **The Interview Process**
   - Opening: "Take me back to when you first realized..."
   - Probing questions:
     - "What triggered that thought?"
     - "What did you do next?"
     - "Who else was involved?"
     - "What were you trying to achieve?"
     - "How did you imagine success?"
   - Emotional exploration:
     - "How did you feel when...?"
     - "What worried you about...?"
     - "What excited you most?"

3. **Data Synthesis**
   - Timeline mapping:
     - First thought → Purchase → Use → Outcome
     - Capture all micro-steps
     - Note emotional peaks/valleys
   - Pattern identification:
     - Common triggers
     - Shared anxieties
     - Similar outcomes desired
     - Consistent struggling moments

### Phase 2: Job Mapping
**Step-by-step Job Architecture:**

1. **Main Job Identification**
   - Core functional job:
     - Primary task/goal
     - Measurable outcome
     - Time/effort invested
   - Example formats:
     - "Help me [achieve outcome] when [situation]"
     - "Enable me to [action] so that [result]"

2. **Related Jobs Mapping**
   - Upstream jobs:
     - What happens before main job?
     - Preparation requirements
     - Information gathering needs
   - Downstream jobs:
     - What follows completion?
     - Result utilization
     - Value extraction
   - Adjacent jobs:
     - Simultaneous needs
     - Complementary tasks
     - Integration requirements

3. **Job Step Decomposition**
   For each main job, break down into steps:
   
   **Step 1: Define**
   - Determine criteria
   - Set objectives
   - Establish constraints
   
   **Step 2: Locate**
   - Find options
   - Identify resources
   - Discover solutions
   
   **Step 3: Prepare**
   - Gather materials
   - Set up environment
   - Get ready to execute
   
   **Step 4: Confirm**
   - Verify readiness
   - Check assumptions
   - Validate approach
   
   **Step 5: Execute**
   - Perform core job
   - Monitor progress
   - Adjust as needed
   
   **Step 6: Monitor**
   - Track results
   - Measure success
   - Identify issues
   
   **Step 7: Modify**
   - Make adjustments
   - Optimize performance
   - Improve outcomes
   
   **Step 8: Conclude**
   - Finalize results
   - Document learnings
   - Prepare for next cycle

### Phase 3: Success Criteria Definition
**For each job step:**

1. **Desired Outcomes Metrics**
   - Speed metrics:
     - "Minimize time to..."
     - "Reduce steps needed..."
   - Quality metrics:
     - "Increase accuracy of..."
     - "Improve reliability of..."
   - Output metrics:
     - "Maximize yield from..."
     - "Increase throughput of..."

2. **Importance vs Satisfaction**
   - Survey design:
     - Importance: "How important is [outcome]?" (1-5)
     - Satisfaction: "How satisfied with current [outcome]?" (1-5)
   - Opportunity score:
     - Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
     - Prioritize high opportunity scores

3. **Constraints & Barriers**
   - Resource constraints:
     - Time available
     - Money to spend
     - Skills required
   - Environmental constraints:
     - Location limitations
     - Technology access
     - Social factors
   - Emotional barriers:
     - Fear of failure
     - Social judgment
     - Change resistance

### Phase 4: Solution Evaluation
**Assessing Current Solutions:**

1. **Competitive Job Performance**
   - Map competitors to job steps
   - Rate performance per step (1-10)
   - Identify over/underserved steps
   - Find white space opportunities

2. **Solution Fit Analysis**
   - Functional fit:
     - Which steps addressed?
     - How well performed?
     - What's missing?
   - Emotional fit:
     - Anxiety reduction
     - Confidence building
     - Pride generation
   - Social fit:
     - Status enhancement
     - Group belonging
     - Identity expression

3. **Innovation Opportunity Matrix**
   ```
   High Importance + Low Satisfaction = Core Innovation
   High Importance + High Satisfaction = Incremental Improvement
   Low Importance + Low Satisfaction = Niche Opportunity
   Low Importance + High Satisfaction = Avoid/Deprioritize
   ```

### Phase 5: Product Strategy Development
**From Jobs to Features:**

1. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Map features to job steps
   - Calculate coverage score
   - Assess differentiation potential
   - Estimate implementation effort
   - Create priority matrix

2. **Product Roadmap Alignment**
   - Quarter 1: Address highest opportunity jobs
   - Quarter 2: Fill critical job gaps
   - Quarter 3: Enhance job performance
   - Quarter 4: Enable new related jobs

3. **Messaging Strategy**
   - Lead with job outcome
   - Demonstrate job performance
   - Address job anxieties
   - Show social proof
   - Quantify time/effort savings
