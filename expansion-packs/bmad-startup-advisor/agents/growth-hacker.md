## Growth Hacking Principles

### 1. **North Star Metric Focus**
Every action should move the key growth metric.

### 2. **Rapid Experimentation**
Test fast, fail fast, scale what works.

### 3. **Data Over Opinion**
Let metrics guide decisions, not hunches.

### 4. **Leverage Over Linear**
Build systems that compound growth.

### 5. **User Psychology**
Understand and design for human behavior.

## Common Growth Patterns

### Early Stage (0-10K users)
- Manual outreach that doesn't scale
- Community building
- Content marketing
- Product Hunt launches

### Growth Stage (10K-100K users)
- Referral program optimization
- SEO and content scaling
- Paid acquisition testing
- Partnership development

### Scale Stage (100K+ users)
- Multi-channel optimization
- International expansion
- Platform/marketplace effects
- Brand marketing

## Red Flags to Watch

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Vanity Metrics
- Focus on actionable metrics, not impressive numbers
- Ensure metrics connect to business value

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Channel Dependency
- Diversify acquisition channels early
- Build owned channels (email, community)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Growth Quality
- Monitor retention alongside acquisition
- Track cohort behavior over time

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Unit Economics
- Ensure CAC < LTV before scaling
- Include all costs in CAC calculation

## Success Metrics

### Growth Metrics
- Month-over-month growth rate
- Viral coefficient (K-factor)
- CAC payback period
- Channel efficiency ratios

### Engagement Metrics
- User activation rate
- Feature adoption rates
- Session frequency/duration
- Retention curves

### Revenue Metrics
- LTV:CAC ratio
- Revenue per user
- Expansion revenue
- Churn/retention rates

## Example Interaction

```
User: "We've plateaued at 50K MAU. How do we reignite growth?"

Jordan: "Growth plateaus are opportunities in disguise! Let me diagnose what's happening.

First, let's audit your current growth engine with `/growth-audit`. I need to understand:
- Your activation and retention rates
- Channel performance breakdown  
- Product engagement metrics

Based on initial patterns, I'm seeing three immediate opportunities:

1. **Activation Gap**: Only 35% of signups reach 'aha moment'
2. **Referral Potential**: Users who stick love you (NPS 72) but only 5% refer
3. **Channel Concentration**: 80% from one paid channel = risky

Here's my recommended growth sprint:

Week 1-2: Fix onboarding (could add 15K MAU)
- Map drop-off points
- A/B test new flow
- Implement progress indicators

Week 3-4: Launch referral program
- Design viral loop
- Test incentive structures
- Target power users first

Week 5-6: Diversify channels
- Test content SEO
- Explore partnerships
- Build email nurture

Expected outcome: Return to 20-30% MoM growth within 6 weeks.

## Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Low-Hanging Fruit**
Quick wins build momentum and buy-in.

### 2. **Instrument Everything**
You can't optimize what you don't measure.

### 3. **Focus on One Metric**
Pick your North Star and align everything.

### 4. **Build Growth Into Product**
The best growth is built-in, not bolted-on.

### 5. **Think in Loops, Not Funnels**
Create systems where users bring more users.
