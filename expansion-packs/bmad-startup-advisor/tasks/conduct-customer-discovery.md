## Customer Discovery Introduction

```markdown
Hi! I'm Alex. Let's talk to real customers and discover what they actually need.

The #1 reason startups fail? They build products nobody wants. Customer discovery prevents this.

**Quick Assessment:**
1. How many potential customers have you talked to?
2. What assumptions are you making about their needs?
3. Who is your ideal customer?
4. What problem are you solving for them?
5. How confident are you in your solution?

Let's turn your assumptions into validated facts.
```

## Phase 1: Preparation (Days 1-3)

### Step 1.1: Define Learning Goals
```markdown
**What We Need to Learn:**

About the Customer:
□ Who has the problem most acutely?
□ What triggers the problem?
□ How are they solving it today?
□ What's their decision process?
□ What's their budget?

About the Problem:
□ How painful is it really?
□ How often does it occur?
□ What's the cost of not solving it?
□ Is it a vitamin or painkiller?

About the Solution:
□ What would ideal look like?
□ What features are must-have?
□ What would they pay?
□ How would they want to buy?

**Your Top 5 Assumptions to Test:**
1. {{assumption_1}}
2. {{assumption_2}}
3. {{assumption_3}}
4. {{assumption_4}}
5. {{assumption_5}}
```

### Step 1.2: Identify Target Interviewees

**Recruiting Strategy:**
1. Cold outreach (LinkedIn/Email)

   - Not selling, just learning
   - 15-minute commitment

```

### Step 1.3: Interview Preparation

- Note-taking: Dedicated note-taker

**Materials Needed:**
□ Interview script (see Phase 2)

**Interview Best Practices:**
DO:
✓ Listen 80%, talk 20%
✓ Ask open-ended questions
✓ Dig into specific examples
✓ Embrace awkward silence
✓ Follow unexpected threads

DON'T:
✗ Pitch your solution
✗ Ask leading questions
✗ Talk about features
✗ Argue with feedback
✗ Ask hypotheticals
```

## Phase 2: Interview Execution (Days 4-14)

### Step 2.1: The Mom Test Script
```markdown
**Opening (2 minutes):**
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. I'm researching how 
[type of person] handle [problem area]. I'm not selling anything - 
just trying to learn. Mind if I record for my notes?"

**Context Setting (5 minutes):**
1. "First, can you tell me about your role/situation?"
2. "Walk me through your typical day/workflow"
3. "What are your main responsibilities/goals?"

**Problem Discovery (15 minutes):**
1. "When it comes to [area], what's the hardest part?"
2. "Tell me about the last time you encountered [problem]"
   - What triggered it?
   - What did you do?
   - How long did it take?
   - Who else was involved?

3. "How often does this happen?"
4. "What happens if you don't address it?"
5. "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this?"

**Current Solutions (10 minutes):**
1. "How do you solve this today?"
2. "What tools/processes do you use?"
3. "What do you like about current approach?"
4. "What frustrates you most?"
5. "Have you tried other solutions?"
   - What worked/didn't work?
   - Why did you switch/stop?

**Economic Discovery (5 minutes):**
1. "How much time do you spend on this?"
2. "What's the impact when it goes wrong?"
3. "Who has budget authority for solutions?"
4. "What's typical budget for this type of tool?"
5. "How do you measure success?"

**Solution Exploration (8 minutes):**
1. "If you had a magic wand, what would perfect look like?"
2. "What would need to be true for you to switch solutions?"
3. "Who else needs to be involved in decisions?"
4. "What would prevent you from adopting a new solution?"

**Wrap-up (5 minutes):**
1. "What haven't I asked that I should have?"
2. "Who else should I talk to about this?"
3. "Can I follow up if I have questions?"
4. "Would you like to stay updated on my research?"

Thank them and send follow-up within 24 hours.
```

### Step 2.2: Active Listening Techniques
```markdown
**Follow-up Prompts:**
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "Why is that important to you?"

**Digging Deeper:**
When they say: "It's frustrating"
You ask: "What specifically is frustrating?"

When they say: "It takes too long"
You ask: "Walk me through the process"

When they say: "It's expensive"
You ask: "Expensive compared to what?"

**Reading Between Lines:**
- Emotional language = Real pain
- Specific examples = Actual experience
- Vague answers = Not a real problem
- Excitement = Potential champion
```

### Step 2.3: Real-time Analysis
```markdown
**During Interview Scoring:**

Problem Severity:
□ Frequency: Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Rarely
□ Impact: Critical/High/Medium/Low
□ Emotion: Angry/Frustrated/Annoyed/Indifferent
□ Current Solution: Nothing/Manual/Competitor/Workaround

Customer Quality:
□ Decision Maker: Yes/No/Influencer
□ Budget Authority: Yes/No/Influence
□ Problem Fit: Perfect/Good/Okay/Poor
□ Accessibility: Easy/Medium/Hard

Solution Fit:
□ Magic Wand Alignment: High/Medium/Low
□ Switching Likelihood: High/Medium/Low
□ Price Sensitivity: Low/Medium/High

**Red Flags:**
🚩 "That's not really a problem for us"
🚩 "We're happy with current solution"
🚩 "Maybe someday in the future"
🚩 "If it was free we might try it"
🚩 Can't remember specific examples

**Green Flags:**
✅ Gets animated discussing problem
✅ Shares specific painful stories
✅ Currently paying for inferior solution
✅ Tried multiple solutions already
✅ Introduces you to others with same problem
```

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Analysis (Days 15-18)

### Step 3.1: Pattern Recognition
```markdown
**Interview Data Analysis:**

Create a spreadsheet with:
- Interview date/name
- Segment
- Problem severity (1-10)
- Current solution
- Budget range
- Key quotes
- Surprising insights

**Pattern Identification:**
After 10+ interviews, look for:
1. Same problem mentioned by >40%
2. Similar current solutions
3. Common frustrations
4. Repeated feature requests
5. Consistent price anchoring

**Segment Analysis:**
Which segment has:
- Highest pain scores?
- Most budget authority?
- Easiest to reach?
- Fastest sales cycle?
- Highest lifetime value?

**Priority Ranking:**
Rank segments by:
1. Problem severity × 
2. Ability to pay × 
3. Accessibility =
4. **Opportunity Score**
