## Metrics Philosophy

### Principles
```markdown
1. Measure outcomes, not outputs
2. Focus on flow, not utilization
3. Use leading indicators
4. Make metrics actionable
5. Avoid gaming behaviors
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
```markdown
❌ Individual velocity tracking
❌ Comparing team velocities
❌ Over-indexing on estimates
❌ Vanity metrics
❌ Punishment for "bad" metrics

✅ Team-level metrics
✅ Trend analysis
✅ Flow optimization
✅ Business value focus
✅ Learning from data
```

## Team-Level Metrics

### Velocity and Predictability
```markdown
Velocity:
- Definition: Story points completed per sprint
- Use: Capacity planning, not performance
- Calculation: 3-sprint rolling average
- Caution: Never compare across teams

Predictability:
- Formula: (Delivered / Committed) × 100%
- Target: 80-90% (not 100%)
- Action: Root cause if <70% or >95%
```

### Cycle Time Analysis
```markdown
Measurement Points:
- Lead Time: Request → Delivery
- Cycle Time: Start → Delivery
- Process Time: Active work only
- Wait Time: Blocked/waiting

Optimization:
1. Map value stream
2. Identify wait states
3. Reduce batch size
4. Improve flow
5. Measure impact
```

### Quality Metrics
```markdown
Defect Density:
- Defects per story point
- Trend over time
- By component/feature

Escaped Defects:
- Found in production
- Severity levels
- Root cause patterns

Technical Debt:
- Debt ratio trend
- Remediation rate
- Impact on velocity
```

### Team Health Metrics
```markdown
Categories:
1. Delivery (velocity, predictability)
2. Quality (defects, coverage)
3. Stability (WIP, flow)
4. Happiness (surveys, retention)
5. Learning (improvements, skills)

Visualization: Spider chart
Review: Every retrospective
Action: Address lowest scores
```

## Portfolio-Level Metrics

### Epic and Feature Metrics
```markdown
Epic Cycle Time:
- Funnel → Done duration
- By stage breakdown
- Delay reasons
- Value delivery time

Feature Completion:
- Features per PI
- On-time delivery %
- Scope change rate
- Business value delivered
```

### Investment Metrics
```markdown
ROI Tracking:
- Value delivered / Cost
- By strategic theme
- By value stream
- Trend analysis

Cost per Point:
- Total cost / Points delivered
- Include all roles
- Trend over time
- By team/train
```

### Strategic Alignment
```markdown
OKR Progress:
- Key result completion %
- Objective confidence
- Contributing features
- Impediment impact

Theme Distribution:
- Actual vs planned %
- Capacity allocation
- Value contribution
- Adjustment frequency
```

## Flow Metrics Deep Dive

### Flow Velocity
```markdown
Definition: Number of items completed per time period
Calculation: Count of done items / time period
Use cases:
- Throughput tracking
- Capacity planning
- Trend analysis

Visualization:
- Run chart
- Cumulative flow
- Histogram
```

### Flow Efficiency
```markdown
Definition: Active time / Total time
Calculation: Process time / Lead time × 100%
Industry benchmark: 15% typical, 40% good
Improvement levers:
- Reduce wait states
- Smaller batches
- Better prioritization
- Dependency management
```

### Flow Time
```markdown
Definition: Time from start to finish
Percentiles tracked:
- 50th (median)
- 85th (predictability)
- 95th (outliers)

Analysis:
- Distribution shape
- Outlier investigation
- Size correlation
- Complexity factors
```

### Flow Load
```markdown
Definition: Number of items in progress
WIP Limits:
- Team capacity based
- Empirically determined
- Adjusted quarterly

Monitoring:
- Daily WIP tracking
- Aging items
- Blocked items
- Queue lengths
```

### Flow Distribution
```markdown
Categories:
- Features (new value)
- Defects (quality)
- Risk (security/compliance)
- Debt (technical debt)

Target distribution:
- Features: 60-80%
- Defects: 5-15%
- Risk: 5-10%
- Debt: 10-20%
```

## Analysis Techniques

### Statistical Process Control
```markdown
Control Charts:
- Upper/lower control limits
- Standard deviation bands
- Outlier identification
- Process stability

When to investigate:
- Point outside limits
- 7+ points trend
- Unusual patterns
- Sudden shifts
```

### Root Cause Analysis
```markdown
5 Whys for Metrics:
1. Why is cycle time increasing?
   - More items blocked
2. Why are items blocked?
   - Dependencies not ready
3. Why are dependencies late?
   - Poor coordination
4. Why poor coordination?
   - No visibility
5. Why no visibility?
   - Missing dependency board

Action: Implement dependency tracking
```

### Correlation Analysis
```markdown
Common correlations:
- Story size ↔ Cycle time
- WIP ↔ Flow efficiency
- Technical debt ↔ Velocity
- Team stability ↔ Predictability

Investigation process:
1. Scatter plot creation
2. Correlation calculation
3. Causation hypothesis
4. Experiment design
5. Validation
```

- Educate on velocity purpose
- Focus on value delivered
- Use predictability instead
- Celebrate outcomes
- Track customer satisfaction
```

### Pitfall: "Too many metrics"
```markdown
Solution:
- Start with 3-5 key metrics
- Add only if actionable
- Regular metric reviews
- Sunset unused metrics
- Focus on trends
```

### Pitfall: "Gaming the metrics"
```markdown
Prevention:
- Multiple balancing metrics
- Focus on outcomes
- Team ownership
- Trend over absolutes
- Celebrate learning
```

## Success Patterns

### Pattern 1: Start Simple
```markdown
Phase 1: Basic velocity and burndown
Phase 2: Add cycle time
Phase 3: Implement flow metrics
Phase 4: Advanced analytics
Phase 5: Predictive metrics
```

### Pattern 2: Make it Visible
```markdown
- Big visible charts
- Real-time updates
- Team ownership
- Regular reviews
- Action tracking
```

### Pattern 3: Drive Action
```markdown
Every metric should:
- Answer a question
- Drive a decision
- Trigger an action
- Show improvement
- Tell a story
```
