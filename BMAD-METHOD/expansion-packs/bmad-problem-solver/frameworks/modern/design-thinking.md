# Design Thinking Framework

## Overview
Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that integrates the needs of people, possibilities of technology, and requirements for business success. Popularized by IDEO and Stanford's d.school, it provides a systematic method for solving complex problems through empathy, creativity, and experimentation.

## When to Use
- Complex, ambiguous problems without clear solutions
- User experience and customer journey challenges
- Innovation and new product development
- Service design and process improvement
- When traditional approaches haven't worked
- Cross-functional team collaboration needed

## The 5-Stage Process

## Stage 1: EMPATHIZE ü§ç
**Goal:** Understand users and their needs deeply

### Key Activities:
- **User Interviews**: Deep, open-ended conversations
- **Observation**: Watching users in their environment
- **Immersion**: Experiencing the problem firsthand
- **Journey Mapping**: Documenting user experiences
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identifying all affected parties

### Methods and Tools:

#### User Interview Framework:
```
üéØ EMPATHY INTERVIEW STRUCTURE

OPENING (5 min):
"Tell me about your typical day..."
"Walk me through how you currently..."

EXPLORATION (15 min):
"What frustrates you most about...?"
"What would make this easier?"
"Describe a time when..."

EMOTIONS (10 min):
"How does that make you feel?"
"What worries you about...?"
"What excites you about...?"

CLOSING (5 min):
"What haven't I asked that I should?"
"If you had a magic wand..."
```

```

## Stage 2: DEFINE üéØ
**Goal:** Frame the problem from user's perspective

### Key Activities:
- **Synthesize** research findings
- **Identify** patterns and insights
- **Create** user personas
- **Define** point of view statement
- **Establish** design criteria

### Point of View Statement:
```
üìù POV TEMPLATE:

[USER] needs [NEED] because [INSIGHT]

Example:
"Busy parents need a simplified meal planning system 
because they feel overwhelmed by daily food decisions 
and want to spend more quality time with their children."

CRITERIA FOR GOOD POV:
‚úÖ Human-centered (focuses on user)
‚úÖ Broad enough to allow creativity
‚úÖ Narrow enough to be manageable
‚úÖ Based on research insights
```

### How Might We Questions:
```
ü§î HMW FRAMEWORK:

Transform POV into "How Might We..." questions:

POV: "Parents need simplified meal planning..."

HMW Questions:
‚Ä¢ How might we reduce decision fatigue for meal planning?
‚Ä¢ How might we make healthy eating effortless for families?
‚Ä¢ How might we turn meal planning into quality time?
‚Ä¢ How might we automate repetitive food decisions?
```

## Stage 3: IDEATE üí°
**Goal:** Generate many creative solution ideas

### Key Activities:
- **Brainstorming** sessions
- **SCAMPER** technique application
- **Crazy 8s** rapid ideation
- **Brainwriting** individual then group
- **Dot voting** for prioritization

### Ideation Rules:
```
üåü BRAINSTORMING PRINCIPLES:

1. DEFER JUDGMENT
   ‚Ä¢ No criticism during generation
   ‚Ä¢ Build on "wild" ideas
   ‚Ä¢ Quantity over quality first

2. STRIVE FOR QUANTITY
   ‚Ä¢ Aim for 50+ ideas per session
   ‚Ä¢ Set time limits (7 minutes)
   ‚Ä¢ Keep energy high

3. BUILD ON IDEAS
   ‚Ä¢ "Yes, and..." instead of "Yes, but..."
   ‚Ä¢ Combine and modify ideas
   ‚Ä¢ Create idea clusters

4. STAY FOCUSED
   ‚Ä¢ Keep HMW question visible
   ‚Ä¢ Bring discussions back to user
   ‚Ä¢ One conversation at a time

5. BE VISUAL
   ‚Ä¢ Sketch ideas quickly
   ‚Ä¢ Use colors and symbols
   ‚Ä¢ Make ideas tangible
```

### Ideation Techniques:

#### Crazy 8s:
```
‚ö° CRAZY 8s METHOD:
1. Fold paper into 8 sections
2. Set timer for 8 minutes
3. Sketch 1 idea per section per minute
4. No details - just concepts
5. Share and discuss all ideas
```

#### SCAMPER for Ideas:
```
üîÑ SCAMPER TECHNIQUE:
S - Substitute: What can be substituted?
C - Combine: What can be combined?
A - Adapt: What can be adapted?
M - Modify: What can be modified?
P - Put to other use: How else can this be used?
E - Eliminate: What can be removed?
R - Reverse: What can be rearranged?
```

## Stage 4: PROTOTYPE üõ†Ô∏è
**Goal:** Build quick, testable versions of ideas

### Key Activities:
- **Low-fidelity** prototyping
- **Rapid** building and iteration
- **Assumption** testing
- **Feature** prioritization
- **User flow** creation

### Prototype Types:

### Testing Framework:
```
üß™ TESTING STRUCTURE:

BEFORE TESTING:

‚ñ° Create testing scenarios
‚ñ° Prepare prototype
‚ñ° Recruit representative users
‚ñ° Plan observation method

DURING TESTING:
‚ñ° Set context and expectations
‚ñ° Give user realistic tasks
‚ñ° Observe without interfering

"Think aloud as you go..."
"There are no wrong answers..."

TASKS (20 min):
"Imagine you need to [specific scenario]"
"Show me how you would..."
"What would you do next?"

WRAP-UP (3 min):
"What did you like most/least?"
"What would you change?"
"Any other thoughts?"

OBSERVATION NOTES:
‚Ä¢ Task completion rate
‚Ä¢ Time to complete

    style D fill:#9999ff
    style E fill:#ffff99
```

### 2. **Jobs-to-be-Done Integration**
```
üéØ JTBD + DESIGN THINKING:

1. EMPATHIZE: What job is the user hiring your product for?
2. DEFINE: What's the job statement?
3. IDEATE: How might we help users get the job done better?
4. PROTOTYPE: Test job completion effectiveness
5. TEST: Validate job satisfaction
```

### 3. **Systems Thinking Integration**
```
üåê SYSTEMS VIEW:
‚Ä¢ Map ecosystem of stakeholders
‚Ä¢ Identify system leverage points
‚Ä¢ Consider unintended consequences
‚Ä¢ Design for system-wide impact
```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Start with user research, not assumptions
- Include diverse perspectives on team
- Embrace "beginner's mind"
- Prototype early and often
- Test with real users regularly
- Document and share learnings
- Iterate based on feedback

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Skip the empathy phase
- Design for yourself
- Fall in love with first ideas
- Over-perfect prototypes
- Test with internal team only
- Ignore negative feedback
- Stop after first solution

## Team Composition

### Core Roles:
- **Facilitator**: Guides process, keeps energy up
- **Researcher**: Leads empathy and testing phases
- **Designer**: Creates prototypes and visualizations
- **Domain Expert**: Provides context and constraints
- **User Representative**: Advocates for user needs

### Workshop Structure (1-Day Sprint):
```
‚è∞ DESIGN THINKING DAY:

9:00 - 9:30    Opening & Empathy Review
9:30 - 10:30   Define POV & HMW Questions
10:45 - 12:00  Ideate (Multiple Rounds)
1:00 - 2:30    Prototype Building
2:45 - 4:00    Test with Users
4:00 - 4:30    Synthesis & Next Steps
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: **Rushing to Solutions**
‚ùå Jumping to ideation without empathy
‚úÖ Spend 40% of time on empathy and define

### Pitfall 2: **Perfect Prototypes**
‚ùå Over-polishing early prototypes
‚úÖ Keep prototypes rough and testable

### Pitfall 3: **Internal Testing Only**
‚ùå Testing with team members
‚úÖ Always test with real users

### Pitfall 4: **One-Time Exercise**
‚ùå Treating it as workshop, not mindset
‚úÖ Embed into regular development process

## Integration with Agile/Lean

### Design Thinking + Agile:
```
üîÑ AGILE INTEGRATION:

Sprint 0: Empathize & Define (Research Sprint)
Sprint 1-2: Ideate & Prototype (Build Sprint)
Sprint 3: Test & Learn (Validation Sprint)
Sprint 4+: Iterate based on learnings
```

### Design Thinking + Lean Startup:
```
üöÄ LEAN INTEGRATION:

BUILD: Prototype solutions
MEASURE: Test with users  
LEARN: Synthesize insights
PIVOT/PERSEVERE: Based on learnings
```

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ User needs clearly understood and documented
- ‚úÖ Problem statement validated with users
- ‚úÖ Multiple solution concepts generated (20+)
- ‚úÖ Prototypes tested with 5+ users
- ‚úÖ Clear next steps defined based on learnings
- ‚úÖ Team alignment on user-centered approach
