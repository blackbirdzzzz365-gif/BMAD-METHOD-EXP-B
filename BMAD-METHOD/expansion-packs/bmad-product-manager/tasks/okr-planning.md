# okr-planning

REQUIRED: Use this task to create and align Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

## Configuration
```yaml
task:
  name: OKR Planning and Alignment
  type: framework-based
  priority: high
  elicit: true
```

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of company/product strategy
- Clarity on time period (quarterly/annual)
- Stakeholder buy-in for process

## OKR Framework Principles

**Objectives**: Qualitative, inspirational goals that answer "Where do we want to go?"
**Key Results**: Quantitative measures that answer "How will we know we got there?"

Rules:
- 3-5 Objectives per period
- 3-5 Key Results per Objective
- Key Results must be measurable
- Ambitious but achievable (70% achievement is success)

## Interactive Flow

### STEP 1: Strategic Context
GATHER context by asking:
1. What's the time period for these OKRs? (Q1, Q2, Annual, etc.)
2. What's the company/product vision we're supporting?
3. What level are these OKRs for? (Company, Product, Team, Individual)
4. What were last period's OKRs and achievement levels?
5. What major challenges or opportunities exist?

WAIT for comprehensive responses.

### STEP 2: Objective Brainstorming
FACILITATE brainstorming:

"Let's identify potential objectives. Good objectives are:"
- Inspirational and memorable
- Qualitative, not quantitative
- Aligned with strategy
- Clear and unambiguous

PROMPT: "What are the 3-5 most important things we need to achieve this [period]?"

For each suggestion, TEST:
- Does it inspire action?
- Is it outcome-focused (not task-focused)?
- Does it ladder up to company strategy?
- Would achieving this truly move us forward?

### STEP 3: Objective Prioritization
PRESENT objectives for prioritization:

```
Potential Objectives:
1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]
3. [Objective 3]
4. [Objective 4]
5. [Objective 5]
```

APPLY prioritization criteria:
- Strategic Alignment (High/Med/Low)
- Impact Potential (High/Med/Low)
- Resource Requirements (High/Med/Low)
- Dependencies (Many/Some/Few)

ASK: "Which 3 objectives would create the most value if achieved?"

### STEP 4: Key Results Definition
For each selected Objective, DEVELOP Key Results:

**Objective 1: [Objective text]**

ASK for each:
1. "How will we measure success for this objective?"
2. "What metrics would prove we achieved this?"
3. "What's the current baseline?"
4. "What's an ambitious but achievable target?"

Key Result format:
- [Verb] [metric] from [X] to [Y]
- Example: "Increase MAU from 100K to 150K"

VALIDATE each Key Result:
- Is it quantifiable?
- Do we have a clear baseline?
- Is the target ambitious (stretch goal)?
- Can we influence this directly?
- Is it outcome-based (not output-based)?

### STEP 5: OKR Cascade Alignment
CHECK alignment across levels:

**Company OKRs** (if applicable)
↓
**Product OKRs** (what we're creating)
↓
**Team OKRs** (who will execute)

For each Product OKR, ASK:
- "How does this support company objectives?"
- "Which teams need to contribute?"
- "What would their supporting OKRs look like?"

CREATE alignment map:
```
Company Obj → Product Obj → Team Obj
[CEO Obj 1] → [Our Obj 1] → [Team A Obj]
                          → [Team B Obj]
```

### STEP 6: Confidence and Risk Assessment
For each OKR, ASSESS:

**Confidence Level:**
- High (80%+): Clear path, resources available
- Medium (50-80%): Some unknowns, manageable risks
- Low (<50%): Major dependencies or unknowns

**Key Risks:**
1. Resource constraints
2. Technical dependencies
3. Market factors
4. Team capabilities

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigation approach]
- [Risk 2]: [Mitigation approach]

### STEP 7: Initiative Mapping
CONNECT OKRs to initiatives:

| Key Result | Required Initiatives | Owner | Priority |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|----------|
| [KR 1.1] | [Initiative A, B] | [Name] | P0 |
| [KR 1.2] | [Initiative C] | [Name] | P1 |

ASK: "Do we have the right initiatives to achieve these Key Results?"

### STEP 8: Tracking and Review Cadence
ESTABLISH measurement plan:

**Tracking Setup:**
- Data sources for each KR
- Dashboard/reporting tools
- Update frequency (weekly/bi-weekly)
- Owner for each metric

**Review Cadence:**
- Weekly: Progress check-ins
- Monthly: Formal scoring
- Quarterly: Full review and reset

**Scoring Method:**
- 0.0-0.3: Off track (red)
- 0.4-0.6: Needs attention (yellow)
- 0.7-1.0: On track (green)

### STEP 9: Communication Plan
CREATE rollout plan:

**Stakeholder Communication:**
1. Leadership presentation
2. All-hands announcement
3. Team deep-dives
4. Wiki documentation
5. Visual dashboards

**Key Messages:**
- Why these OKRs matter
- How they connect to vision
- What success looks like
- How progress will be tracked

## Deliverables
- Finalized OKRs (3-5 Objectives, each with 3-5 KRs)
- Alignment cascade map
- Initiative roadmap
- Tracking dashboard spec
- Communication materials

## Success Criteria
- OKRs inspire and focus teams
- Clear measurement criteria
- Aligned across organization
- Balanced ambition and achievability
- Regular tracking established

## Templates Generated
ASK: "Would you like me to generate:"
1. OKR summary document
2. Team cascade worksheet
3. Tracking dashboard template
4. Presentation slides
