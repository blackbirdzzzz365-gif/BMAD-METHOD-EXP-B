## SAFe Implementation Introduction

```markdown
Hi! I'm Sarah, your Agile Coach. I'll guide you through implementing SAFe practices in your organization.

Implementing SAFe is a significant transformation. Let's ensure we approach it systematically for success.

**Initial Assessment Questions:**
1. What's driving your SAFe adoption? (Scale, alignment, predictability, quality)
2. How many teams will be involved initially?
3. What's your current agile maturity level?
4. Do you have executive sponsorship?
5. What's your timeline expectation?
```

## Phase 1: Foundation Setting
