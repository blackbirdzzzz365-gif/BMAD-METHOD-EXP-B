## Phase 0: Launch Classification (Days 1-2)

### Step 0.1: Launch Type Determination
**Lead Agent:** product-lead

**Adaptive Questions:**
1. **What type of product launch?**
   - New Product → Full Launch Path
   - Major Feature → Feature Launch Path
   - Platform Update → Platform Launch Path
   - Beta/Preview → Soft Launch Path

2. **What's the risk level?**
   - High Risk (new market/tech) → Conservative Path
   - Medium Risk (new segment) → Balanced Path
   - Low Risk (existing market) → Aggressive Path

3. **What's the market readiness?**
   - Market Creating → Education Focus
   - Market Competing → Differentiation Focus
   - Market Leading → Innovation Focus

### Step 0.2: Resource Assessment
**Determine constraints:**
- Development resources
- Marketing budget
- Support capacity
- Timeline flexibility

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation (Weeks 1-4)

**Lead Agent:** product-strategist

1. **Market Validation Deep Dive**
   ```
   IF market_researcher available:
     TRIGGER market entry analysis
     WAIT for market insights
   ELSE:

- If market conditions changed → Adjust strategy
- If all green → Proceed to next phase

## Phase 2: Launch Planning (Weeks 5-8)

### Step 2.1: Cross-Functional Alignment
**All agents collaborate**

**Adaptive Planning Matrix:**
```
For Each Department:
  IF launch_type = "new_product":

    Marketing: Full campaign development
    Sales: Complete training program
    Support: Comprehensive documentation
  ELIF launch_type = "feature":
    Engineering: Feature flag setup
    Marketing: In-app announcement
    Sales: Feature sheet update
    Support: FAQ preparation
  ELIF launch_type = "platform":
    Engineering: API versioning
    Marketing: Developer outreach
    Sales: Partner enablement
    Support: Developer support
```

### Step 2.2: Risk Mitigation Planning
**Adaptive Risk Response:**

1. **Technical Risks**
   ```
   IF performance_risk = high:
     - Load testing at 3x capacity
     - Auto-scaling configuration
     - CDN optimization
     - Database indexing
   ```

2. **Market Risks**
   ```
   IF adoption_risk = high:
     - Extended beta period
     - Influencer early access
     - Case study development
     - Money-back guarantee
   ```

3. **Operational Risks**
   ```
   IF support_risk = high:
     - Additional support staffing
     - Escalation procedures
     - Self-service resources
     - Community moderation
   ```

### Step 2.3: Launch Sequence Design
**Adaptive Rollout:**

```python
def determine_rollout_sequence(launch_type, risk_level, market_readiness):
    if launch_type == "new_product":
        if risk_level == "high":
            return ["closed_beta", "open_beta", "soft_launch", "full_launch"]
        else:
            return ["open_beta", "soft_launch", "full_launch"]
    
    elif launch_type == "feature":
        if risk_level == "high":
            return ["internal", "1%_users", "10%_users", "50%_users", "100%"]
        else:
            return ["internal", "10%_users", "100%"]
    
    elif launch_type == "platform":
        return ["partners", "developers", "general_availability"]
```

## Phase 3: Launch Execution (Weeks 9-12)

### Step 3.1: Launch Day Orchestration
**Lead Agent:** product-lead

**Adaptive Launch Day Protocol:**
```

    - 11:00 AM: Customer email
  ELSE:
    - Gradual rollout per plan
    - Monitor each stage
    - Pause if issues
```

### Step 3.2: Real-Time Monitoring
**All agents monitor:**

**Adaptive Response Triggers:**
```
IF error_rate > 5%:
  INITIATE rollback procedure
  
IF adoption < 50% expected:
  INCREASE marketing push
  ANALYZE friction points
  
IF support_volume > 200% expected:
  ACTIVATE overflow team
