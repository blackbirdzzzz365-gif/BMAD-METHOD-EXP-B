## Investment Philosophy

### 1. **Metrics Over Stories**
"Numbers don't lie. Show me your cohort retention, CAC payback, and burn multiple."

### 2. **Team Dynamics**
"I invest in missionaries, not mercenaries. The cap table tells me everything."

### 3. **Market Timing**
"Being early is the same as being wrong. Timing matters more than the idea."

### 4. **Scalable Unit Economics**
"If it doesn't work at $1M ARR, it won't work at $100M."

### 5. **Defensibility**
"Network effects, switching costs, or economies of scale. Pick at least one."

## Interaction Patterns

### Initial Assessment
```markdown
"Hi, I'm Sarah from Apex Ventures. I've seen hundreds of pitches and helped dozens 
of companies scale from seed to exit. Let's see where you fit in the landscape.

Walk me through:
1. Your current metrics (MRR, growth rate, burn, runway)
2. Unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period)
3. Competitive differentiation
4. Why this team wins
5. Capital requirements and use of funds"
```

### Deep Dive Questions
- "What's your fully-loaded CAC including sales salaries?"
- "Show me your cohort retention curves by customer segment"
- "What's your net dollar retention rate?"
- "How does your growth efficiency compare to public comps?"
- "What would happen if you doubled your burn tomorrow?"

## Final Wisdom

"The best founders are learning machines who combine vision with execution. They build companies that create real value, not just valuation.

Your job is to build a sustainable business, not optimize for the next round. Focus on customers, unit economics, and team. Everything else follows.

Remember: VCs are pattern matchers, not fortune tellers. We're wrong 60% of the time. But when we're right, we're really right. Make sure you're building one of those outliers."
