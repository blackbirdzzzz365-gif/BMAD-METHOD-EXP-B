+
+ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
+
+CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
+
+## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
+
+```yaml
+IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
+  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
+  - Dependencies map to {root}/{type}/{name}
+  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
+  - Example: create-doc.md → {root}/tasks/create-doc.md
+  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
+REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "analyze market"→*market-analysis→conduct-market-analysis task, "research competitors" would be dependencies->tasks->competitor-analysis combined with the dependencies->templates->competitor-matrix-tmpl.yaml), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
+activation-instructions:
+  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
+  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
+  - STEP 3: Greet user with your name/role and mention `*help` command
+  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
+  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
+  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
+  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
+  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
+  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
+  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
+  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
+  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

+# Market Research Knowledge Base
+
+## Core Market Research Principles
+
+### 1. Research Integrity
+- Always use multiple data sources for validation
+- Document all assumptions and limitations
+- Present findings objectively without bias
+- Distinguish between facts and interpretations
+- Provide confidence levels for projections
+
+### 2. Customer-Centricity
+- Start with customer needs, not product features
+- Use Jobs-to-be-Done framework for deep insights
+- Validate assumptions through behavioral data
+- Consider emotional and social factors, not just functional
+- Map complete customer journeys
+
+### 3. Competitive Intelligence Ethics
+- Only use publicly available information
+- Respect intellectual property
+- Avoid industrial espionage
+- Document information sources
+- Focus on strategic insights, not tactics
+
+## Market Analysis Frameworks
+
+### TAM/SAM/SOM Methodology
+**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
+- Top-down: Industry reports × relevant percentage
+- Bottom-up: Total customers × average revenue per customer
+- Value theory: Value created × value capture rate
+
+**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**
+- Geographic constraints
+- Regulatory limitations
+- Technical requirements
+- Channel accessibility
+
+**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
+- Realistic market share based on:
+  - Competition intensity
+  - Resources available
+  - Go-to-market strategy
+  - Differentiation strength
+
+### Porter's Five Forces
+1. **Supplier Power**: Concentration, switching costs, forward integration threat
+2. **Buyer Power**: Concentration, price sensitivity, backward integration
+3. **Competitive Rivalry**: Number of competitors, industry growth, exit barriers
+4. **Threat of New Entry**: Capital requirements, economies of scale, brand loyalty
+5. **Threat of Substitutes**: Performance/price trade-off, switching costs
+
+### Customer Segmentation Approaches
+- **Demographic**: Age, income, education, location
+- **Psychographic**: Values, attitudes, interests, lifestyle
+- **Behavioral**: Usage patterns, brand loyalty, benefits sought
+- **Needs-based**: Problems to solve, jobs to be done
+- **Value-based**: Price sensitivity, lifetime value
+
+## Research Methodologies
+
+### Qualitative Research
+- In-depth interviews
+- Focus groups
+- Ethnographic observation
+- Social listening
+- Customer journey mapping
+
+### Quantitative Research
+- Surveys and questionnaires

+- Statistical analysis
+- Trend analysis
+- Conjoint analysis
+
+### Secondary Research Sources
+- Industry reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
+- Government statistics
+- Trade associations
+- Academic research
+- Financial reports
+- News and media
+
+## Consumer Psychology Principles
+
+### Behavioral Economics
+- Loss aversion: People fear losses more than value gains
+- Anchoring: First information heavily influences decisions
+- Social proof: People follow others' behavior
+- Scarcity: Limited availability increases desirability
+- Framing effects: Presentation impacts perception
+
+### Innovation Adoption Curve
+1. **Innovators** (2.5%): Risk-takers, tech-savvy
+2. **Early Adopters** (13.5%): Opinion leaders, connected
+3. **Early Majority** (34%): Deliberate, practical
+4. **Late Majority** (34%): Skeptical, traditional
+5. **Laggards** (16%): Resistant to change
+
+## Market Entry Strategies
+
+### Go-to-Market Approaches
+- **Direct**: Sell directly to end customers
+- **Channel**: Through partners/distributors
+- **Platform**: Multi-sided marketplace
+- **Freemium**: Free tier with paid upgrades
+- **Land and Expand**: Start small, grow within accounts
+
+### Positioning Strategies
+- **Cost Leadership**: Lowest price provider
+- **Differentiation**: Unique features/benefits
+- **Focus**: Narrow market segment
+- **Blue Ocean**: Create new market space
+
+## Data Analysis Best Practices
+

+2. Methodology and Approach
+3. Key Findings
+4. Detailed Analysis
+5. Strategic Implications
+6. Recommendations
+7. Appendices
+
+### Writing Style
+- Lead with insights, not process
+- Use active voice
+- Avoid jargon and acronyms
+- Support claims with evidence
+- Make recommendations actionable
+
+## Interactive Research Principles
+
+### Elicitation Techniques
+- Start broad, then narrow focus
+- Ask "why" five times for root causes
+- Use hypothetical scenarios
+- Probe for specific examples
+- Validate understanding frequently
+
+### Stakeholder Management
+- Identify all stakeholders early
+- Understand their objectives
+- Communicate in their language
+- Provide relevant insights
+- Enable informed decisions
+
+## Market Research Ethics
+

+ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
+
+CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
+
+## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
+
+```yaml
+IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
+  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
+  - Dependencies map to {root}/{type}/{name}
+  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|frameworks|etc...), name=file-name
+  - Example: create-doc.md → {root}/tasks/create-doc.md
+  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
+REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "write PRD"→*prd→create-prd task, "prioritize features" would be dependencies->tasks->rice-prioritization combined with the dependencies->templates->rice-matrix-tmpl.yaml), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
+activation-instructions:
+  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
+  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
+  - STEP 3: Greet user with your name/role and mention `*help` command
+  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
+  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
+  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
+  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
+  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
+  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
+  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
+  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

+# Product Management Knowledge Base
+
+## Core PM Principles
+
+### 1. User-Centric Product Development
+- Start with user problems, not solutions
+- Validate assumptions through research and testing
+- Measure success by user outcomes, not feature delivery
+- Build empathy through direct user interaction
+- Iterate based on feedback and data
+
+### 2. Strategic Thinking
+- Balance short-term wins with long-term vision
+- Consider second and third-order effects
+- Think in systems and platforms, not just features
+- Understand business model implications
+- Maintain competitive awareness
+
+### 3. Data-Driven Decision Making
+- Define metrics before building
+- Distinguish between vanity and actionable metrics
+- Use both qualitative and quantitative data
+- Run controlled experiments
+- Accept that not all decisions can be data-driven
+
+## Key PM Frameworks
+
+### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
+**Core Concept**: People "hire" products to get jobs done in their lives.
+
+**Framework Structure**:
+- **Main Job**: The primary outcome users seek
+- **Related Jobs**: Supporting tasks around the main job
+- **Emotional Jobs**: How users want to feel
+- **Social Jobs**: How users want to be perceived
+
+**Key Questions**:
+- What progress is the user trying to make?
+- What are the circumstances of struggle?
+- What are users currently hiring to do this job?
+- What would have to be true for them to switch?
+
+**Application**:
+- Use for product discovery and innovation
+- Frame features as job executors
+- Identify underserved jobs as opportunities
+- Avoid feature-centric thinking
+
+### OKR Framework
+**Objectives and Key Results** align teams around measurable goals.
+
+**Objective Qualities**:
+- Qualitative and inspirational
+- Ambitious but achievable
+- Time-bound (usually quarterly)
+- Aligned with company strategy
+- Memorable and motivating
+
+**Key Result Qualities**:
+- Quantitative and measurable
+- Specific and unambiguous
+- Aggressive but realistic (70% = success)
+- Observable by third parties
+- Controllable by team
+
+**Best Practices**:
+- Limit to 3-5 objectives per period
+- Each objective has 3-5 key results
+- Cascade but don't copy from above
+- Grade honestly and learn from misses
+- Separate OKRs from performance reviews
+
+### RICE Prioritization
+**Formula**: Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
+
+**Reach** (per time period):
+- Number of users affected
+- Frequency of impact
+- Be specific about time frame
+
+**Impact** scale:
+- 3 = Massive impact
+- 2 = High impact
+- 1 = Medium impact
+- 0.5 = Low impact
+- 0.25 = Minimal impact
+
+**Confidence** (percentage):
+- Based on evidence quality
+- Previous similar experiences
+- Reduces overconfidence bias
+
+**Effort** (person-months):
+- Include all disciplines
+- Consider dependencies
+- Account for complexity
+
+**Usage Tips**:
+- Use consistently across initiatives
+- Document assumptions
+- Revisit scores quarterly
+- Consider strategic adjustments
+
+### Platform vs Feature Decisions
+
+**Feature Approach When**:
+- Single, specific use case
+- Quick market validation needed
+- Resource constrained
+- Low reuse potential
+- Learning phase
+
+**Platform Approach When**:
+- Multiple use cases identified
+- Core to product strategy
+- High reuse expected
+- Ecosystem enablement
+- Scale is priority
+
+**Evaluation Criteria**:
+- Number of potential use cases
+- Strategic importance
+- Resource availability
+- Time to market pressure
+- Technical debt implications
+

+# Jobs-to-be-Done Framework Guide
+
+## Overview
+Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding what motivates people to make the choices they do. People don't buy products; they "hire" them to get jobs done.
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### 1. Focus on Progress
+Users are trying to make progress in their lives. Understand:
+- Where they are now (current state)
+- Where they want to be (desired state)
+- What's blocking progress (constraints)
+
+### 2. Circumstances Matter
+The context in which a job arises is critical:
+- When does this job become important?
+- Where does it occur?
+- Who else is involved?
+- What constraints exist?
+
+### 3. Competition is Broad
+Your competition isn't just similar products:
+- Current solutions (even if makeshift)
+- Doing nothing
+- DIY approaches
+- Hiring people
+
+## Job Categories
+
+### Functional Jobs
+The practical task to accomplish:
+- "Cut a piece of wood"
+- "Transfer money to friend"
+- "Track project progress"
+
+### Emotional Jobs
+How people want to feel:
+- "Feel confident about decision"
+- "Avoid anxiety about overspending"
+- "Feel in control of schedule"
+
+### Social Jobs
+How people want to be perceived:
+- "Look professional in meetings"
+- "Be seen as innovative"
+- "Demonstrate competence"
+
+## JTBD Interview Technique
+
+### Setup Questions
+1. "When did you first start looking for something to solve [problem]?"
+2. "Tell me about the last time you [experienced this problem]"
+3. "What were you trying to accomplish?"
+
+### Progress Questions
+1. "What kind of solutions did you try?"
+2. "What did you like/dislike about each?"
+3. "What would a perfect solution do for you?"
+
+### Four Forces Questions
+**Push** (problems with current state):
+- "What's frustrating about your current approach?"
+
+**Pull** (attraction to new solution):
+- "What attracted you to [new solution]?"
+
+**Anxiety** (concerns about change):
+- "What worried you about switching?"
+
+**Habit** (comfort with status quo):
+- "What would you miss about current approach?"
+
+## Job Story Format
+
+Instead of: "As a [persona], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
+
+Use: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]"
+
+Examples:
+- "When I'm planning my week on Sunday night, I want to see all my commitments in one place, so I can spot conflicts before they happen"
+- "When my team asks about project status in our standup, I want to quickly show our progress, so I can maintain credibility and trust"
+
+## Identifying Opportunities
+
+### Underserved Jobs
+- Important but not satisfied well
+- People cobble together solutions
+- High willingness to pay
+
+### Overserved Jobs
+- Current solutions too complex
+- Features unused
+- Opportunity to simplify
+
+### Non-consumption
+- No current solution hired
+- Job remains undone
+- Latent demand exists
+

+
+## Common Mistakes
+
+### 1. Focusing on Demographics
+Wrong: "Millennials want mobile apps"
+Right: "When I'm commuting, I want to use my time productively"
+
+### 2. Leading with Solutions
+Wrong: "Users want dashboards"
+Right: "Users want to understand their business health at a glance"
+
+### 3. Ignoring Emotional/Social Jobs
+Wrong: Only focusing on functional requirements
+Right: Understanding the full job complexity
+
+### 4. Narrow Competition View
+Wrong: "Our competition is other SaaS products"
+Right: "We compete with spreadsheets, consultants, and doing nothing"
+
+## Applying JTBD to Product Development
+
+### Discovery
+- Interview users about struggles
+- Identify job statements
+- Map current solutions
+- Find opportunities
+
+### Definition
+- Frame features as job executors
+- Define success as job completion
+- Consider all job dimensions
+- Write job stories
+
+### Validation
+- Test job hypotheses
+- Measure job satisfaction
+- Iterate based on completion
+- Refine understanding
+
+### Marketing
+- Message around jobs
+- Show progress enabled
+- Address anxieties
+- Highlight outcomes
+
+## JTBD Prioritization
+
+Evaluate jobs based on:
+1. **Importance**: How important is this job to users?
+2. **Satisfaction**: How well is it currently served?
+3. **Frequency**: How often does the job arise?
+4. **Willingness to Pay**: Will users pay for better solution?
+
+**Opportunity Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)**
+
+High importance + Low satisfaction = High opportunity
+
+## Examples by Industry
+
+### B2B SaaS
+Job: "When I'm preparing for board meetings, I want to quickly create compelling data visualizations, so I can clearly communicate our progress and secure continued support"
+
+### E-commerce
+Job: "When I'm gift shopping under time pressure, I want to find something thoughtful without extensive research, so I can maintain relationships while managing my busy life"
+
+### Healthcare
+Job: "When I notice concerning symptoms, I want to understand if I need immediate care, so I can protect my health without unnecessary anxiety or expense"
+
+## Integration with Other Frameworks
+
+### With OKRs
+- Objectives address important jobs
+- Key Results measure job satisfaction
+- Initiatives execute job solutions
+
+### With RICE
+- Reach: How many have this job?
+- Impact: How important is the job?
+- Confidence: How well do we understand it?
+- Effort: Complexity to satisfy job
+
+### With User Stories
+- Transform jobs into stories
+- Maintain job context
+- Define acceptance as job done
+- Test against job success

+# jtbd-analysis
+
+REQUIRED: Use this task to conduct Jobs-to-be-Done analysis for product discovery
+
+## Configuration
+```yaml
+task:
+  name: Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis
+  type: framework-based
+  priority: high
+  elicit: true
+```
+
+## Prerequisites
+- Basic understanding of product/feature area
+- Access to users or user research
+- Clear scope of analysis
+
+## Framework Overview
+
+Jobs-to-be-Done focuses on understanding what users are trying to accomplish, not what they say they want. The framework identifies:
+- **Main Job**: The core task/outcome
+- **Related Jobs**: Supporting tasks
+- **Emotional Jobs**: How users want to feel
+- **Social Jobs**: How users want to be perceived
+
+## Interactive Flow
+
+### STEP 1: Context Gathering
+ASK the user:
+1. What product/feature area are we analyzing?
+2. Who are the primary users/customers?
+3. What triggered this JTBD analysis?
+4. Do you have any user research or feedback to reference?
+
+WAIT for responses before proceeding.
+
+### STEP 2: Initial Job Hypothesis
+Based on context, PRESENT initial hypothesis:
+"Based on what you've shared, I believe users are trying to [main job hypothesis]. Is this accurate?"
+
+REFINE based on feedback.
+
+### STEP 3: Job Breakdown Analysis
+
+#### Main Job Identification
+GUIDE through questions:
+1. "When users encounter [situation], what are they trying to get done?"
+2. "What would success look like for them?"
+3. "What progress are they trying to make in their lives?"
+
+Document: **Main Job**: [Verb] + [Object] + [Context]
+Example: "Manage team progress when working remotely"
+
+#### Functional Job Components
+EXPLORE:
+- What specific tasks must be completed?
+- What information do they need?
+- What decisions must they make?
+- What outcomes must be achieved?
+
+#### Emotional Jobs
+ASK:
+- "How do users want to feel when this job is done?"
+- "What anxieties are they trying to avoid?"
+- "What confidence are they seeking?"
+
+Common emotional jobs:
+- Feel in control
+- Feel confident
+- Avoid anxiety
+- Feel accomplished
+
+#### Social Jobs
+INVESTIGATE:
+- "How do users want to be perceived by others?"
+- "What impression are they trying to make?"
+- "Whose opinion matters to them?"
+
+### STEP 4: Current Solution Analysis
+UNDERSTAND current approaches:
+1. How are users solving this today?
+2. What tools/processes do they use?
+3. Where do current solutions fall short?
+4. What workarounds have they created?
+
+CREATE comparison:
+```
+Current Solution | Satisfaction | Pain Points
+----------------|--------------|-------------
+[Solution 1]    | Low/Med/High | [Issues]
+[Solution 2]    | Low/Med/High | [Issues]
+```
+
+### STEP 5: Success Criteria Definition
+DEFINE what "job done well" looks like:
+
+**Objective Outcomes:**
+- Speed: How quickly?
+- Quality: How well?
+- Consistency: How reliably?
+
+**Subjective Outcomes:**
+- Confidence level
+- Satisfaction score
+- Likelihood to recommend
+
+### STEP 6: Opportunity Mapping
+IDENTIFY opportunities:
+
+1. **Underserved Needs**: Where current solutions fail
+2. **Overserved Areas**: Where we could simplify
+3. **Non-consumption**: Who isn't served at all
+4. **Related Jobs**: Adjacent jobs we could address
+
+Present as:
+```
+Opportunity | Impact | Effort | Priority
+------------|--------|--------|----------
+[Opp 1]     | High   | Medium | P1
+[Opp 2]     | Medium | Low    | P2
+```
+
+### STEP 7: Solution Principles
+Based on JTBD analysis, DERIVE principles:
+
+**Must Have:**
+- [Principle 1]: Addresses [core job aspect]
+- [Principle 2]: Enables [key outcome]
+
+**Should Avoid:**
+- [Anti-pattern 1]: Conflicts with [job aspect]
+- [Anti-pattern 2]: Creates [unwanted feeling]
+
+### STEP 8: Feature Implications
+TRANSLATE jobs into features:
+
+| Job Component | Feature Implication | Priority |
+|--------------|-------------------|----------|
+| [Functional job] | [Feature idea] | High |
+| [Emotional job] | [UX approach] | Medium |
+| [Social job] | [Social feature] | Low |
+
+ASK: "Which of these feature implications resonate most with your vision?"
+
+### STEP 9: Validation Planning
+PLAN validation approach:
+1. Which assumptions need testing?
+2. What experiments could we run?
+3. What metrics would indicate success?
+4. Who should we interview next?
+
+## Deliverables
+- Comprehensive JTBD statement
+- Job hierarchy (main + related jobs)
+- Current solution landscape
+- Opportunity matrix
+- Solution principles
+- Feature implications
+- Validation plan
+
+## Success Metrics
+- Clear, actionable job statements
+- Validated with user evidence
+- Differentiated from feature requests
+- Actionable for product development

+# okr-planning
+
+REQUIRED: Use this task to create and align Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
+
+## Configuration
+```yaml
+task:
+  name: OKR Planning and Alignment
+  type: framework-based
+  priority: high
+  elicit: true
+```
+
+## Prerequisites
+- Understanding of company/product strategy
+- Clarity on time period (quarterly/annual)
+- Stakeholder buy-in for process
+
+## OKR Framework Principles
+
+**Objectives**: Qualitative, inspirational goals that answer "Where do we want to go?"
+**Key Results**: Quantitative measures that answer "How will we know we got there?"
+
+Rules:
+- 3-5 Objectives per period
+- 3-5 Key Results per Objective
+- Key Results must be measurable
+- Ambitious but achievable (70% achievement is success)
+
+## Interactive Flow
+
+### STEP 1: Strategic Context
+GATHER context by asking:
+1. What's the time period for these OKRs? (Q1, Q2, Annual, etc.)
+2. What's the company/product vision we're supporting?
+3. What level are these OKRs for? (Company, Product, Team, Individual)
+4. What were last period's OKRs and achievement levels?
+5. What major challenges or opportunities exist?
+
+WAIT for comprehensive responses.
+
+### STEP 2: Objective Brainstorming
+FACILITATE brainstorming:
+
+"Let's identify potential objectives. Good objectives are:"
+- Inspirational and memorable
+- Qualitative, not quantitative
+- Aligned with strategy
+- Clear and unambiguous
+
+PROMPT: "What are the 3-5 most important things we need to achieve this [period]?"
+
+For each suggestion, TEST:
+- Does it inspire action?
+- Is it outcome-focused (not task-focused)?
+- Does it ladder up to company strategy?
+- Would achieving this truly move us forward?
+
+### STEP 3: Objective Prioritization
+PRESENT objectives for prioritization:
+
+```
+Potential Objectives:
+1. [Objective 1]
+2. [Objective 2]
+3. [Objective 3]
+4. [Objective 4]
+5. [Objective 5]
+```
+
+APPLY prioritization criteria:
+- Strategic Alignment (High/Med/Low)
+- Impact Potential (High/Med/Low)
+- Resource Requirements (High/Med/Low)
+- Dependencies (Many/Some/Few)
+
+ASK: "Which 3 objectives would create the most value if achieved?"
+
+### STEP 4: Key Results Definition
+For each selected Objective, DEVELOP Key Results:
+
+**Objective 1: [Objective text]**
+
+ASK for each:
+1. "How will we measure success for this objective?"
+2. "What metrics would prove we achieved this?"
+3. "What's the current baseline?"
+4. "What's an ambitious but achievable target?"
+
+Key Result format:
+- [Verb] [metric] from [X] to [Y]
+- Example: "Increase MAU from 100K to 150K"
+
+VALIDATE each Key Result:
+- Is it quantifiable?
+- Do we have a clear baseline?
+- Is the target ambitious (stretch goal)?
+- Can we influence this directly?
+- Is it outcome-based (not output-based)?
+
+### STEP 5: OKR Cascade Alignment
+CHECK alignment across levels:
+
+**Company OKRs** (if applicable)
+↓
+**Product OKRs** (what we're creating)
+↓
+**Team OKRs** (who will execute)
+
+For each Product OKR, ASK:
+- "How does this support company objectives?"
+- "Which teams need to contribute?"
+- "What would their supporting OKRs look like?"
+
+CREATE alignment map:
+```
+Company Obj → Product Obj → Team Obj
+[CEO Obj 1] → [Our Obj 1] → [Team A Obj]
+                          → [Team B Obj]
+```
+
+### STEP 6: Confidence and Risk Assessment
+For each OKR, ASSESS:
+
+**Confidence Level:**
+- High (80%+): Clear path, resources available
+- Medium (50-80%): Some unknowns, manageable risks
+- Low (<50%): Major dependencies or unknowns
+
+**Key Risks:**
+1. Resource constraints
+2. Technical dependencies
+3. Market factors

+# platform-feature-analysis
+
+REQUIRED: Use this task to analyze platform vs feature decisions
+
+## Configuration
+```yaml
+task:
+  name: Platform vs Feature Decision Analysis
+  type: strategic-analysis
+  priority: high
+  elicit: true
+```
+
+## Prerequisites
+- Clear understanding of the capability being considered
+- Knowledge of current architecture
+- Vision for future product direction
+
+## Framework Overview
+
+Platform investments create reusable capabilities that enable multiple features. Feature investments solve specific user problems directly. This analysis helps decide which approach creates more long-term value.
+
+## Interactive Flow
+
+### STEP 1: Capability Definition
+GATHER context:
+1. What capability/functionality are we considering?
+2. What problem does it solve?
+3. Who are the users (internal/external)?
+4. What triggered this analysis?
+5. What's the timeline pressure?
+
+WAIT for detailed responses.
+
+### STEP 2: Use Case Exploration
+EXPLORE current and future use cases:
+
+**Current Needs:**
+ASK: "What immediate problem needs solving?"
+- Specific user request
+- Current pain point
+- Competitive gap
+
+**Future Possibilities:**
+ASK: "What other problems could this solve if built as a platform?"
+- Similar problems in other areas
+- Future product roadmap needs
+- Partner/ecosystem opportunities
+
+CREATE use case matrix:
+```
+Use Case | User | Frequency | Value | Certainty
+---------|------|-----------|-------|----------
+[Case 1] | [Who] | Daily | High | Confirmed
+[Case 2] | [Who] | Weekly | Med | Likely
+[Case 3] | [Who] | Monthly | Low | Possible
+```
+
+### STEP 3: Architecture Analysis
+EVALUATE technical implications:
+
+**Feature Approach:**
+- Scope: Narrow, specific solution
+- Complexity: Lower, focused
+- Time to market: Faster
+- Flexibility: Limited to use case
+- Maintenance: Isolated
+
+**Platform Approach:**
+- Scope: Broad, extensible capability
+- Complexity: Higher, abstracted
+- Time to market: Slower initially
+- Flexibility: Supports many use cases
+- Maintenance: Centralized
+
+ASK: "What would the architecture look like for each approach?"
+
+### STEP 4: Cost-Benefit Analysis
+QUANTIFY both approaches:
+
+**Feature Approach Costs:**
+- Initial development: [X] person-months
+- Maintenance: [Y] person-months/year
+- Future extensions: [Z] per new use case
+- Technical debt: [Accumulated over time]
+
+**Platform Approach Costs:**
+- Initial development: [2-3X] person-months
+- Maintenance: [1.5Y] person-months/year
+- Future extensions: [0.2Z] per new use case
+- Technical debt: [Managed centrally]
+
+**Break-even Analysis:**
+"How many use cases before platform pays off?"
+Platform becomes worthwhile at [N] use cases
+
+### STEP 5: Risk Assessment
+IDENTIFY risks for each approach:
+
+**Feature Approach Risks:**
+- Proliferation of similar solutions
+- Inconsistent user experience
+- Higher long-term maintenance
+- Difficult to extend/modify
+- Technical debt accumulation
+
+**Platform Approach Risks:**
+- Over-engineering
+- Delayed time to market
+- May not meet all specific needs
+- Higher initial investment
+- Adoption challenges
+
+SCORE risks (High/Medium/Low) and mitigation strategies.
+
+### STEP 6: Strategic Alignment
+EVALUATE strategic fit:
+
+Questions to consider:
+1. Does this align with product vision?
+2. Is this a core differentiator?
+3. Will competitors need this too?
+4. Does this enable new business models?
+5. Is this part of our platform strategy?
+
+Strategic Scoring:
+```
+Factor | Feature | Platform | Winner
+-------|---------|----------|--------
+Vision Alignment | Med | High | Platform
+Differentiation | Low | High | Platform
+Speed to Market | High | Low | Feature
+Future Flexibility | Low | High | Platform
+```
+
+### STEP 7: Phased Approach Evaluation
+CONSIDER hybrid strategy:
+
+"Could we start with a feature and evolve to platform?"
+
+**Phase 1**: Feature implementation
+- Solve immediate need
+- Learn from usage
+- Validate assumptions
+
+**Phase 2**: Platform extraction
+- Identify patterns
+- Abstract capabilities
+- Build platform layer
+
+ASSESS: "Is this evolutionary approach viable?"
+
+### STEP 8: Stakeholder Impact
+ANALYZE organizational implications:
+
+**Feature Approach:**
+- Who owns it? [Single team]
+- Who maintains it? [Same team]
+- Who can extend it? [Limited]
+- Documentation needs? [Minimal]
+
+**Platform Approach:**
+- Who owns it? [Platform team]
+- Who maintains it? [Centralized]
+- Who can extend it? [All teams]
+- Documentation needs? [Extensive]
+
+ASK: "Do we have the organizational structure to support a platform?"
+
+### STEP 9: Decision Framework
+APPLY decision criteria:
+
+**Choose FEATURE when:**
+- Single, well-defined use case
+- Speed to market critical
+- Limited reuse expected
+- Resource constrained
+- Proving market need
+
+**Choose PLATFORM when:**
+- Multiple use cases identified
+- Core to product strategy
+- High reuse expected
+- Technical debt concerns
+- Ecosystem play
+
+**Score each criterion:**
+| Criterion | Weight | Feature | Platform |
+|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
+| Use cases | 25% | 1 | 5 |
+| Strategic | 25% | 2 | 5 |
+| Resources | 20% | 5 | 2 |
+| Timeline | 20% | 5 | 2 |
+| Risk | 10% | 3 | 3 |
+| **Total** | 100% | **3.0** | **3.6** |
+
+### STEP 10: Recommendation and Next Steps
+SYNTHESIZE analysis:
+
+**Recommendation:** [Platform/Feature/Phased]
+
+**Rationale:**
+1. [Key reason 1]
+2. [Key reason 2]
+3. [Key reason 3]
+
+**Success Criteria:**
+- [Metric 1]
+- [Metric 2]
+- [Metric 3]
+
+**Next Steps:**
+1. Socialize decision with stakeholders
+2. Create technical design doc
+3. Establish ownership model
+4. Build implementation roadmap
+5. Define success metrics
+
+## Deliverables
+- Platform vs Feature analysis matrix
+- Cost-benefit comparison
+- Risk assessment
+- Strategic alignment score
+- Phased approach plan (if applicable)
+- Final recommendation with rationale
+
+## Success Metrics
+- Clear decision rationale
+- Stakeholder alignment
+- Quantified trade-offs
+- Actionable next steps

+# rice-prioritization
+
+REQUIRED: Use this task to prioritize features/initiatives using the RICE framework
+
+## Configuration
+```yaml
+task:
+  name: RICE Prioritization Framework
+  type: framework-based
+  priority: high
+  elicit: true
+```
+
+## Prerequisites
+- List of features/initiatives to prioritize
+- Basic understanding of user base
+- Rough effort estimates available
+
+## RICE Framework Components
+
+**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**
+
+- **Reach**: How many users affected per time period
+- **Impact**: How much it impacts those users (0.25-3)
+- **Confidence**: How confident in estimates (0-100%)
+- **Effort**: Person-months required
+
+## Interactive Flow
+
+### STEP 1: Setup and Context
+GATHER information:
+1. What are we prioritizing? (features, initiatives, bugs, etc.)
+2. What time period for Reach? (per month, quarter, year)
+3. Who are the stakeholders for this prioritization?
+4. Any constraints or must-haves to consider?
+5. What's our team capacity?
+
+WAIT for responses.
+
+### STEP 2: Initiative Inventory
+CREATE comprehensive list:
+
+ASK: "List all features/initiatives you're considering for prioritization."
+
+ORGANIZE into table:
+```
+ID | Initiative Name | Brief Description | Requester
+---|----------------|-------------------|----------
+1  | [Name]         | [Description]     | [Who]
+2  | [Name]         | [Description]     | [Who]
+```
+
+CONFIRM: "Is this the complete list? Any additions?"
+
+### STEP 3: Reach Estimation
+For each initiative, CALCULATE Reach:
+
+GUIDE with questions:
+- "How many users will this impact?"
+- "Is this all users or a segment?"
+- "What's the frequency of impact?"
+
+**Reach Calculation Examples:**
+- All users (100K) × once per month = 100K
+- Power users (10K) × daily (30x) = 300K
+- New users (5K/month) × onboarding = 5K
+
+DOCUMENT assumptions:
+```
+Initiative: [Name]
+Reach: [Number] users/[time period]
+Assumption: [How calculated]
+```
+
+### STEP 4: Impact Scoring
+EXPLAIN Impact scale:
+- **3** = Massive impact (game-changer)
+- **2** = High impact (very positive)
+- **1** = Medium impact (positive)
+- **0.5** = Low impact (minimal)
+- **0.25** = Minimal impact (barely noticeable)
+
+For each initiative, ASK:
+1. "How much will this improve the user experience?"
+2. "Does this solve a major pain point?"
+3. "Will this drive key metrics significantly?"
+
+PROVIDE examples:
+- "Reducing load time from 5s to 1s" → Impact: 2
+- "Adding dark mode" → Impact: 0.5
+- "Fixing critical workflow bug" → Impact: 3
+
+### STEP 5: Confidence Assessment
+EVALUATE confidence (0-100%):
+
+Consider factors:
+- **100%**: Proven with data, done before
+- **80%**: Strong evidence, minor unknowns
+- **50%**: Reasonable assumptions, some risk
+- **20%**: Many unknowns, experimental
+
+For each initiative, DISCUSS:
+- "What evidence supports these estimates?"
+- "What are the key uncertainties?"
+- "Have we done similar things before?"
+
+Lower confidence for:
+- New technology/approach
+- Uncertain user behavior
+- External dependencies
+- Regulatory concerns
+
+### STEP 6: Effort Estimation
+ESTIMATE in person-months:
+
+BREAK DOWN by:
+- Design effort
+- Development effort
+- QA/testing effort
+- Launch/migration effort
+
+ASK for each:
+1. "How many engineers needed?"
+2. "How long will development take?"
+3. "Any special skills required?"
+4. "Dependencies on other teams?"
+
+**Effort Scale:**
+- Small: 0.5-1 person-months
+- Medium: 2-4 person-months
+- Large: 5-10 person-months
+- XL: 10+ person-months
+
+### STEP 7: RICE Score Calculation
+CALCULATE for all initiatives:
+
+| Initiative | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
+|-----------|-------|---------|------------|--------|------------|
+| [Name 1]  | 100K  | 2       | 80%        | 3      | 53.3K      |
+| [Name 2]  | 50K   | 1       | 100%       | 1      | 50K        |
+| [Name 3]  | 200K  | 0.5     | 50%        | 4      | 12.5K      |
+
+**Formula**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence%) / Effort
+
+SORT by RICE score descending.
+
+### STEP 8: Sensitivity Analysis
+TEST assumptions:
+
+"Let's validate our top priorities. What if:"
+- Reach was 50% lower?
+- Impact was one level less?
+- Effort doubled?
+
+IDENTIFY which initiatives are:
+- **Robust**: High priority regardless
+- **Sensitive**: Priority depends on assumptions
+- **Borderline**: Close to cutoff line
+
+### STEP 9: Strategic Adjustments
+CONSIDER factors beyond RICE:
+
+**Strategic Alignment:**
+- Does this support OKRs?
+- Technical debt addressed?
+- Competitive necessity?
+- Platform investment?
+
+**Dependencies:**
+- Must do X before Y?
+- Shared components?
+- Team availability?
+
+ADJUST priority order if needed:
+```
+Original Rank | Adjusted Rank | Reason
+-------------|---------------|--------
+#3           | #1            | Blocks #2 and #4
+#5           | #3            | Strategic initiative
+```
+
+### STEP 10: Roadmap Creation
+BUILD execution plan:
+
+**Quarter/Sprint Allocation:**
+```
+Q1: [Initiative 1, 2] - Total effort: 4 PM
+Q2: [Initiative 3, 4] - Total effort: 5 PM
+Q3: [Initiative 5, 6] - Total effort: 4 PM
+```
+
+**Team Assignment:**
+- Team A: [Initiatives 1, 3, 5]
+- Team B: [Initiatives 2, 4, 6]
+
+**Success Metrics:**
+Define how we'll measure success for each.
+
+## Deliverables

+# McKinsey 7S Framework
+
+## Overview
+
+The McKinsey 7S Framework is a management model that describes 7 factors to organize a company in a holistic and effective way. Developed by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman at McKinsey & Company, it emphasizes the interconnectedness of organizational elements.
+
+## The Seven Elements
+
+### Hard Elements (Easier to Define and Manage)
+
+#### 1. Strategy
+- **Definition**: The plan devised to maintain and build competitive advantage
+- **Key Questions**:
+  - What is our strategy?
+  - How do we intend to achieve our objectives?
+  - How do we deal with competitive pressure?
+  - How are changes in customer demands dealt with?
+  - How is strategy adjusted for environmental issues?
+
+#### 2. Structure
+- **Definition**: The way the organization is structured and who reports to whom
+- **Key Questions**:
+  - How is the company/team divided?
+  - What is the hierarchy?
+  - How do the various departments coordinate activities?
+  - How do team members organize and align themselves?
+  - Is decision making centralized or decentralized?
+
+#### 3. Systems
+- **Definition**: The daily activities and procedures that staff members engage in
+- **Key Questions**:
+  - What are the main systems that run the organization?
+  - Where are the controls and how are they monitored?
+  - What internal rules and processes does the team use?
+  - How does information flow through the organization?
+
+### Soft Elements (More Difficult to Describe)
+
+#### 4. Shared Values
+- **Definition**: The core values of the company (called "Superordinate Goals" when the model was first developed)
+- **Key Questions**:
+  - What are the core values?
+  - What is the corporate culture?
+  - How strong are the values?
+  - What are the fundamental values that the company was built on?
+
+#### 5. Skills
+- **Definition**: The actual skills and competencies of the employees
+- **Key Questions**:
+  - What skills does the company need?
+  - Are there any skills gaps?
+  - What is the company known for doing well?
+  - Do current employees have the ability to do the job?
+  - How are skills monitored and assessed?
+
+#### 6. Style
+- **Definition**: The style of leadership adopted
+- **Key Questions**:
+  - How participative is the management/leadership style?
+  - How effective is leadership?
+  - Do employees function competitively or cooperatively?
+  - Are there real teams or just nominal groups?
+
+#### 7. Staff
+- **Definition**: The employees and their general capabilities
+- **Key Questions**:
+  - What positions need to be filled?
+  - Are there gaps in required competencies?
+  - What is the plan for hiring and retention?
+  - How are employees recruited, trained, and motivated?
+
+## Using the 7S Framework
+
+### Step 1: Identify Misalignment
+- Map current state of all 7 elements
+- Identify areas where elements are not aligned
+- Look for inconsistencies and gaps
+
+### Step 2: Determine Optimal Organization Design
+- Define desired future state for each element
+- Ensure all elements support strategy
+- Design for mutual reinforcement
+
+### Step 3: Develop Action Plan
+- Prioritize changes based on impact
+- Consider interdependencies
+- Plan for both hard and soft elements
+
+### Step 4: Implement Changes
+- Start with quick wins
+- Monitor alignment continuously
+- Adjust as needed
+
+## Key Principles
+
+### 1. Interconnectedness
+All seven elements are interconnected. A change in one affects all others.
+
+### 2. Balance
+Both hard and soft elements need equal attention for organizational effectiveness.
+
+### 3. Alignment
+Success comes from alignment of all seven elements with each other and with strategy.
+
+### 4. No Single Factor
+No single element is more important than others - they all contribute to success.
+
+## Common Applications
+
+### 1. Organizational Change
+- Merger integration
+- Restructuring
+- Culture transformation
+- Digital transformation
+
+### 2. Performance Improvement
+- Identifying root causes of problems
+- Optimizing organizational effectiveness
+- Aligning organization with strategy
+
+### 3. Strategy Implementation
+- Ensuring organization can execute strategy
+- Identifying implementation barriers
+- Building implementation roadmap
+
+## Best Practices
+
+### 1. Holistic Assessment
+- Assess all 7 elements comprehensively
+- Don't focus only on easy-to-change hard elements
+- Consider second-order effects
+
+### 2. Stakeholder Involvement
+- Involve people from different levels
+- Get multiple perspectives
+- Build consensus on current and future state
+
+### 3. Iterative Approach
+- Reassess regularly
+- Adjust based on results
+- Maintain dynamic alignment
+
+### 4. Cultural Sensitivity
+- Pay special attention to soft elements
+- Recognize culture change takes time
+- Address resistance proactively
+
+## Common Pitfalls
+
+### 1. Ignoring Soft Elements
+- Focusing only on structure and systems
+- Underestimating culture and style impact
+- Missing people-related issues
+
+### 2. Sequential Thinking
+- Treating elements independently
+- Missing interconnections
+- Creating new misalignments
+
+### 3. One-Time Exercise
+- Not maintaining alignment over time
+- Missing environmental changes
+- Letting elements drift apart
+
+### 4. Surface Analysis
+- Not digging deep enough
+- Missing root causes
+- Addressing symptoms not causes
+
+## Integration with Other Frameworks
+
+### With Strategic Planning
+- Use after strategy development
+- Ensure organization can deliver strategy
+- Identify capability gaps
+
+### With Change Management
+- Provides change roadmap
+- Identifies resistance points
+- Guides intervention design
+
+### With Performance Management
+- Links organization design to outcomes
+- Identifies performance barriers
+- Guides improvement efforts
+
+## Success Factors
+
+1. **Leadership Commitment**: Active sponsorship from top
+2. **Clear Communication**: Why change is needed
+3. **Adequate Resources**: Time, people, and funding
+4. **Change Capability**: Skills to manage transformation
+5. **Persistence**: Staying course through difficulties
+
+## Measurement and Monitoring
+
+### Alignment Metrics
+- Strategy understanding scores
+- Decision-making speed
+- Cross-functional collaboration
+- Employee engagement
+- Customer satisfaction
+
+### Progress Indicators
+- Milestone achievement
+- Behavior change evidence
+- Performance improvements
+- Culture shift indicators
+- Capability development
+
+The 7S Framework remains one of the most effective tools for organizational diagnosis and design, providing a comprehensive lens for understanding and improving organizational effectiveness.

+
+REQUIRED: Use this task to conduct McKinsey 7S organizational analysis
+
+## Configuration
+```yaml
+task:
+  name: McKinsey 7S Framework Analysis
+  type: organizational-diagnostic
+  priority: high
+  elicit: true
+```
+
+## Prerequisites
+- Understanding of organization structure
+- Access to leadership perspectives
+- Cultural and operational insights
+
+## Framework Overview
+
+The McKinsey 7S Framework examines seven interdependent factors that determine organizational effectiveness:
+- **Hard S's**: Strategy, Structure, Systems
+- **Soft S's**: Shared Values, Skills, Style, Staff
+
+All elements must be aligned for organizational success.
+
+## Interactive Flow
+
+### STEP 1: Purpose and Context
+ASK the user:
+1. What organizational challenge are we addressing?
+2. Is this for current state, future state, or gap analysis?
+3. What level of the organization? (Enterprise, Division, Function)
+4. What recent changes have occurred?
+5. What outcomes do you seek from this analysis?
+
+WAIT for comprehensive responses.
+
+### STEP 2: Strategy Assessment
+
+EXPLORE the Strategy element:
+
+**Definition**: Plan to achieve competitive advantage
+
+ASK progressively:
+1. "How clearly is strategy articulated across the organization?"
+2. "What is the core strategic intent?"
+3. "How does the strategy differentiate from competitors?"
+4. "What are the strategic priorities?"
+5. "How well is strategy understood at different levels?"
+
+ASSESS Strategy:
+```
+Strategy Element Assessment:
+- Clarity: [1-5 scale] - [Evidence]
+- Differentiation: [1-5 scale] - [Evidence]
+- Communication: [1-5 scale] - [Evidence]
+- Execution Focus: [1-5 scale] - [Evidence]
+Overall Strategy Score: [X/5]
+```
+
+### STEP 3: Structure Analysis
+
+EXAMINE the Structure element:
+
+**Definition**: How the organization is organized
+
+MAP current structure:
+- Organizational design (functional, divisional, matrix)
+- Reporting relationships
+- Decision rights
+- Span of control
+- Centralization vs decentralization
+
+ASK: "What structural friction points exist?"
+
+ASSESS Structure:
+```
+Structure Effectiveness:
+- Clarity of Roles: [1-5]
+- Decision Speed: [1-5]
+- Collaboration: [1-5]
+- Customer Focus: [1-5]
+Key Issues: [List friction points]
+```
+
+### STEP 4: Systems Evaluation
